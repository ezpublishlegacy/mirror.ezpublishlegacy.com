[12-05-2005 03:04:12] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> hmmmm... how do I link directly to the referencepicture?
[12-05-2005 03:04:36] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> $node.data_map.kart only gives me "Object".
[12-05-2005 03:04:51] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> (that was just an examplepicture) ;)
[12-05-2005 03:23:41] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> Proteque: use attribute view_gui
[12-05-2005 03:23:53] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> and class_image="reference"
[12-05-2005 03:24:13] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> as a direct link to the object (picture)?
[12-05-2005 03:25:46] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> what I ment was: " <a href={attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.data_map.kart image_class="reference"}>something</a>
[12-05-2005 03:25:55] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> that cant be done right?
[12-05-2005 03:28:13] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ah, as link
[12-05-2005 03:28:18] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> yup
[12-05-2005 03:28:29] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> that's an other story
[12-05-2005 03:28:29] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :)
[12-05-2005 03:28:46] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> tried $node.data_map.kart.url_alias without any luck
[12-05-2005 03:28:51] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> but I am mostly guessing
[12-05-2005 03:29:03] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> having problems finding what I want on the documentationpage
[12-05-2005 03:36:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no, an attribute doesn't have an url alias
[12-05-2005 03:37:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> only nodes do
[12-05-2005 03:38:07] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> I did not mean like an attribute. I only wrote that up there to show him what I ment. (how attribute_view_gui could not be used)
[12-05-2005 03:39:27] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> what I tried was <a href={$node.data_map.kart.url_alias}>
[12-05-2005 03:41:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well it could with proper templating
[12-05-2005 03:41:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and there is no url_alias attribute in any datatype
[12-05-2005 03:45:22] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> so there really isnt a quick and dirty way to do this then?
[12-05-2005 03:45:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> there is sure
[12-05-2005 03:46:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> have a look at the default image template
[12-05-2005 03:47:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> design\standard\templates\content\datatype\view\ezimage.tpl

[12-05-2005 04:14:01] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> thank you.
[12-05-2005 04:14:17] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> but that example could not be used in my case sadly.
[12-05-2005 04:15:37] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> because I have made my own class which has several fields in it. one of them are image. when showing the picture I use {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.data_map.kart image_class="large"} wanted that picture to be a link to the reference-picture.
[12-05-2005 04:16:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, the template shows you how to link directly to an image file
[12-05-2005 04:16:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> whatever the class is
[12-05-2005 04:29:34] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> I think I am blind today. better try this later or something. variables showing to variables showing to variabls. lost track :)
[12-05-2005 04:31:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-05-2005 04:33:47] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> guess I could make an overide of ezimage.tpl and turn on the href and link to image. ut then all images would be links to the original. not only in this template.
[12-05-2005 04:45:57] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> the url I want is in the data_text :D now I just need to wash it the right way
[12-05-2005 05:08:28] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it lives!
[12-05-2005 05:08:44] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i need to fetch a node by attribute value in code - how could one do that?
[12-05-2005 05:11:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> using subTree I guess
[12-05-2005 05:11:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> subtre and attribute filter
[12-05-2005 05:11:39] [#ezpublish] <zrg> there only seems to be fetch by id in php

[12-05-2005 05:52:22] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> talking about trees ... is there a way to order a tree fetch by a nested priority of folders/contained objects  ? so far, it seems to me that all objects in a tree with same priority are put together regardless of the depth in which they are (i.e. objects with priority 2 and 3 in folder with priority 1 should come BEFORE object with priority 1 in folder with priority 2)
[12-05-2005 05:53:45] [#ezpublish] <zrg> dont think there is.. made my own menu code and had to fetch level by level
[12-05-2005 05:54:05] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok...

[12-05-2005 09:20:11] [#ezpublish] <zrg> anyhow.. same problem since yesterday, i need to get a node by value of textline attribute, in code.
[12-05-2005 09:20:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> essentially its external id of object, for import and uptate from outside system

[12-05-2005 09:22:06] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> and then generate remote_ids in your import...
[12-05-2005 09:22:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> the attribute should have unique values but this cant be guaranteed
[12-05-2005 09:23:47] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i mean, input data can be guaranteed to be unique but not ez objects, obviously.. there seems to be remote id field but it seems to be created by ez at object initialization under the hood
[12-05-2005 09:25:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> so, i cant use it to determine if object already exists at next upload
[12-05-2005 09:27:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> hm.. shouldnt all template funtions also be available in php?
[12-05-2005 09:33:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> they are

[12-05-2005 09:38:48] [#ezpublish] <zrg> maybe if i make a module that defines wrapper function to fetch by attribute value, and that function will make http queries to some special page on that ez setup, where result is get by using template function...

[12-05-2005 15:02:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> i like it
[12-05-2005 15:02:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> years of reading slashdot
[12-05-2005 15:03:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> besides, its optional
[12-05-2005 15:03:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> flat UBB style display is still the default
[12-05-2005 15:03:28] [#ezpublish] <zrg> of course, just sayin'
[12-05-2005 15:03:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> if you wanna say a nice way of doing it, try kur5hin.org 's dynamic trhreading
[12-05-2005 15:03:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> likely one of the first ajax apps
[12-05-2005 15:03:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> been around forever
[12-05-2005 15:04:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm even tempted to do some ajax, like in a proper usenet newsreade rwith threading and splitscreen etc
[12-05-2005 15:04:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> think thunderbird
[12-05-2005 15:05:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> only thing: how do you keep track of read and unread'
[12-05-2005 15:05:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> kuro5hin seems to be off the face of earth
[12-05-2005 15:05:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> ?
[12-05-2005 15:06:06] [#ezpublish] <zrg> well, connection refused
[12-05-2005 15:06:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh indeed
[12-05-2005 15:06:21] [#ezpublish] <zrg> bad day today or something
[12-05-2005 15:07:27] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have a rudimentary bugtracker built, would you want it?
[12-05-2005 15:07:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> try http://forum.truthout.org/blog/story/2005/12/2/155535/127
[12-05-2005 15:07:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> got a demo?
[12-05-2005 15:07:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> chose dynamic threaded
[12-05-2005 15:08:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no, cant show, sorry. its just 2 classes and few templates
[12-05-2005 15:09:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> well set it up somewhere?
[12-05-2005 15:09:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> or do me a content package?
[12-05-2005 15:10:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh feeding some high traffic usenet groups into ez would do for a nice stress test
[12-05-2005 15:10:20] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok i try, packaging doesnt work too well
[12-05-2005 15:10:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> why?
[12-05-2005 15:10:44] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it just doesnt, for content at least, classes works ok
[12-05-2005 15:10:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> very nice threading
[12-05-2005 15:11:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> so i think
[12-05-2005 15:16:08] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, i have to make package of classes and also attach related template files, override settings and css i think?
[12-05-2005 15:16:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-05-2005 15:16:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure if it stores css?
[12-05-2005 15:16:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> probably not
[12-05-2005 15:17:00] [#ezpublish] <zrg> package only has classes
[12-05-2005 15:17:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> no it stores templates
[12-05-2005 15:17:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> asks you for it
[12-05-2005 15:17:13] [#ezpublish] <zrg> nope
[12-05-2005 15:17:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> does for me
[12-05-2005 15:18:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> thats how the wiki package works
[12-05-2005 15:18:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, how do you make it, choose content objects?
[12-05-2005 15:19:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-05-2005 15:20:02] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no, then it starts asking for onjects
[12-05-2005 15:20:06] [#ezpublish] <zrg> objects
[12-05-2005 15:20:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> you must select a subtree
[12-05-2005 15:20:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> a generic one for best measure
[12-05-2005 15:20:52] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok.. ill try
[12-05-2005 15:24:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> class defs + templates ?
[12-05-2005 15:24:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-05-2005 15:25:48] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, cross fingers..
[12-05-2005 15:36:58] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, no surprise, it fucked up again
[12-05-2005 15:37:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> works for me
[12-05-2005 15:37:31] [#ezpublish] <zrg> well maybe you can use it.. it put the templates under standard when i installed it
[12-05-2005 15:39:48] [#ezpublish] <zrg> and i have apparently used numeric id's for some stuff :(
[12-05-2005 15:39:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok THAT is a bad idea
[12-05-2005 15:40:48] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yes, it was a while back, guess i did not know better
[12-05-2005 15:41:35] [#ezpublish] <zrg> but, if templates were under plain at first site and i installed it into plain on other, how come templates go to standard?
[12-05-2005 15:44:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think that is default behavior cause plain doesnt always exist not sure though
[12-05-2005 15:46:18] [#ezpublish] <zrg> they were clone sites so pretty much everything is same on both.. well dunno
[12-05-2005 15:54:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> u think the page is gonne be back up today
[12-05-2005 15:55:24] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i doubt, 5 minutes left :P
[12-05-2005 15:55:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually, in CET it's still 65min

[12-05-2005 16:33:29] [#ezpublish] <mstecha> ok... all I wanna know
[12-05-2005 16:33:49] [#ezpublish] <mstecha> how can I view images after embeding them
[12-05-2005 16:45:13] [#ezpublish] <zrg> what do you mean
[12-05-2005 16:52:53] [#ezpublish] <mstecha> if I upload and image and embed it, im not allowed to view it, it says "you do not have sufficient permissions to view this object"
[12-05-2005 16:59:25] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> thru the interface ?
[12-05-2005 16:59:35] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> the admin interface
[12-05-2005 17:00:22] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> k you maybe have to add to the role of anonymous
[12-05-2005 17:00:35] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> to view images
[12-05-2005 17:03:18] [#ezpublish] <zrg> maybe he uploads to media files and that section does not have view images permissions?
[12-05-2005 17:03:34] [#ezpublish] <zrg> anyhow you have to describe better for anyone to help you :P
