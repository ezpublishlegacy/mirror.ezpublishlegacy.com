[01-06-2006 17:09:30] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> I'm having some trouble with moving an ezpublish installatioin from one place to another (my ~/public_html/ to /var/www/html/). This is ezpublish 3.7. The problem is that even though I've moved the files over, I'm using the same database and so on, the admin interface isn't uodated and when I enter the admin interface and click something, it'll go to the previous location of the files, mysite.com/~username/ and so forth. Any ideas?
[01-06-2006 17:10:09] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> This results in my site not being updated in the new location, while it is being updated in the old.
