[05-12-2006 02:31:14] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> just went through the log from yesterday about xhtml strict 1.0
[05-12-2006 02:31:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> what about it
[05-12-2006 02:32:43] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> well.. I'm currently making a site using XHTML 1.1 .. do you know if this will validate with ezxml?
[05-12-2006 02:34:43] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> i mean.. is it possible for the content editors to destroy validation with ezxml?
[05-12-2006 02:35:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> ezxml doesnt accept xhtml
[05-12-2006 02:35:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> but you cant destroy a site with ezxml, i believe

[05-12-2006 04:53:56] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> DiGiTa|_: why is that?
[05-12-2006 04:54:59] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> why do you need xhtml 1.1 ?
[05-12-2006 04:55:39] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> isn't xhtml 1.0 efficient ?
[05-12-2006 04:56:14] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> DiGiTa|_: sure.. but I don't see how that would make it "absurd"
[05-12-2006 04:59:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ie doesn't like xhtml 1.1
[05-12-2006 05:01:02] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> xhtml 1.1 is specific
[05-12-2006 05:01:17] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> if you don't need it,  don't use it
[05-12-2006 05:02:09] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> DiGiTa|_: what in xhtml 1.1 doesn't ie like.. it works perfectly as far as I can see...
[05-12-2006 05:05:05] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ie doesn't uderstand the mime type : application/xhtml+xml
[05-12-2006 05:05:50] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> and if you want to use xhtml 1.1 you should use this mime type
[05-12-2006 05:06:35] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> because if you use mime type  text/html
[05-12-2006 05:06:43] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> iwith xhtml 1.1
[05-12-2006 05:06:47] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it's incorrect
[05-12-2006 05:08:48] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> informations here : http://www.webstandards.org/learn/articles/askw3c/sep2003/
[05-12-2006 05:09:22] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> just for clarification.. if ie gets xhtml 1.1 with mimetype text/html.. will it render this as if it was xhtml 1.0?
[05-12-2006 05:10:00] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> no
[05-12-2006 05:10:12] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> because you declare xhtml 1.1
[05-12-2006 05:10:23] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> is don't know what is xhtml 1.1
[05-12-2006 05:10:27] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> IE
[05-12-2006 05:11:45] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> so then IE assumes it is.. what?.. html 4.01?
[05-12-2006 05:12:24] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> xhtml 1.0 with a nice mimetype and charcode
[05-12-2006 05:13:58] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> Charset

[05-12-2006 05:23:22] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I assumed it was OK as long as it validated on w3c .. but it looks like it doesn't care about mimetype / doctype combination
[05-12-2006 05:36:45] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> hi, the lateral menu tha uses ez.no in documentation, how could i use it? its a extension? or what is?
[05-12-2006 05:47:01] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> alvaro-: as far as i know, this is made with the "treemenu" operator and stylesheets
[05-12-2006 06:01:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> doesnt look so special to me
[05-12-2006 06:05:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think that can be done with stock treemenu and css
[05-12-2006 06:13:47] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> buz: my bad. its done with something called simplified_treemenu.tpl
[05-12-2006 06:13:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> that IS the usual treemenu
[05-12-2006 06:14:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> i must know, i hacked at it last week ;)
[05-12-2006 06:14:42] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no. its not the same as the "treemenu" operator
[05-12-2006 06:15:04] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_7/reference/template_operators/miscellaneous/treemenu
[05-12-2006 06:16:14] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> is not the same as: design/standard/templates/simplified_treemenu/show_simplified_menu.tpl
[05-12-2006 06:17:03] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> its a simplification of the operator which is used in the admin interface..
[05-12-2006 06:17:17] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no javascript
[05-12-2006 06:22:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> i thought the two were combined
[05-12-2006 06:23:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> i cant remember on what it is based though
[05-12-2006 06:23:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think it's done with include recursively, anyway
[05-12-2006 06:25:11] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> yes.. recursion
[05-12-2006 06:25:22] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> treemenu operator does not do that
