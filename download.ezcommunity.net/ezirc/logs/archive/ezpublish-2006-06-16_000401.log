[06-15-2006 04:46:46] [#ezpublish] <yper> hi
[06-15-2006 05:02:02] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hi
[06-15-2006 05:04:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> exists an easy method to remove the ( ) from urls like /(offset)/1 ?
[06-15-2006 05:05:10] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> elaborate please?
[06-15-2006 05:06:18] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i dont like the parentesis (i dont know the english word) , this character "(" or ")"
[06-15-2006 05:06:26] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i dont like the ( in my url's
[06-15-2006 05:06:37] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i think isnt SEO
[06-15-2006 05:07:12] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> where does it "suddenly appear"?
[06-15-2006 05:07:30] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> within search-result?
[06-15-2006 05:07:53] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> it appears when EZP nees to send extra parameters, for example in the foot of a searcho to point the next pags
[06-15-2006 05:08:25] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> its logic becasue EZP need somethng to know what is a parameter and what is the path of the node
[06-15-2006 05:08:28] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> but i dont like it
[06-15-2006 05:10:33] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i think i need only to patch |ezurl , i will serach where is it
[06-15-2006 05:11:49] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> just remember that a hack like that will affect everything that uses view_parameters
[06-15-2006 05:12:11] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> no, i think not
[06-15-2006 05:12:19] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> if i do corecctly
[06-15-2006 05:12:29] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> ok.. good luck
[06-15-2006 05:12:55] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> because EZP will never see a difference
[06-15-2006 05:13:24] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i will give it the parameters in the same site, i dont know where but you say view_parameters
[06-15-2006 05:14:05] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i will use more SEO url's with this patch
[06-15-2006 05:14:55] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> thx Tidemann

[06-15-2006 05:16:13] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i see it, but they are compressed or something
[06-15-2006 05:16:48] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hmm.. did my messages reach the net now?
[06-15-2006 05:17:20] [#ezpublish] <yper> yepp
[06-15-2006 05:18:18] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i see they are gz and tar
[06-15-2006 05:18:43] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> anyways.. i dont think its so easy to change jeremiah, because it will not be possible for eZp to know if it is a view-parameter for the template or an unordered parameter to the module
[06-15-2006 05:19:51] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> well kriss, i dont know too much to understand you, what is an unorderer paraemter the (offset) and a template is the path of a node?
[06-15-2006 05:22:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i will use somethin like that, the first parameter is the path of the node, when it finds a /_name/ then it knows begin to fetch an unorderer parameter with a variable length, news/title/_offset/1/_node/1/2/3.html
[06-15-2006 05:22:56] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> in this rl, there is a path of a node, a parameter offset=1 a parameter node=1/2/3
[06-15-2006 05:26:07] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> where will you use these parameters?
[06-15-2006 05:26:18] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> where i want

[06-15-2006 05:27:16] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> its only n example
[06-15-2006 05:27:38] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> friends, when i installa a pachage and it answer me to override a class
[06-15-2006 05:27:50] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> for example the folder class
[06-15-2006 05:27:55] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> must i override?
[06-15-2006 05:28:20] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i think the package are very important but i dont see good documentation
[06-15-2006 05:31:34] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> aha, i see the packages are tar and zipped, and there is an xml definiton of the classes, looking at it i will know if i must overrwrite or not my class
[06-15-2006 05:31:55] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> and the xml describe how the objects or new class are inserted
[06-15-2006 05:32:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> jeremiah: the _s are also used in the url, so its hard to know what is part of your node-path and not i think
[06-15-2006 05:33:08] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> only if it begins with _ i consider it a aprameter
[06-15-2006 05:33:20] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> so /_offset/1
[06-15-2006 05:33:29] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> offset is a parameter
[06-15-2006 05:34:49] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> he title or name of a node must not beging with _
[06-15-2006 05:35:45] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> do you like an url like (offset)/1 ?, its horrible
[06-15-2006 05:38:46] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i guess you could change it to _offset_/1, the problem with changing it, is that you need to change a lot of templates aswell
[06-15-2006 05:38:51] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> uf, its a dangerous thing to use Packages i see
[06-15-2006 05:39:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i will change all the necesary kris, because i will not use (offset)
[06-15-2006 05:44:10] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> EZP is so overfragmented that its difficult to learn

[06-15-2006 05:53:04] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> eZ publish is indeed very big..
[06-15-2006 05:53:27] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i guess that the
[06-15-2006 05:53:50] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> ( and ) are from lib/ezutils/classes/ezmodule.php
[06-15-2006 05:54:35] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> remote id is for having unique ids for objects inside your installation
[06-15-2006 05:54:44] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> aha, thx
[06-15-2006 05:55:05] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> useful for imports aswell, when you can use the remote id to refer to the "old" inde
[06-15-2006 05:55:05] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> x
[06-15-2006 05:56:05] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> if i have modified templates, for example the folder tpl in my EZP and then i install for example the gallery package, it overrite my changes in folder tpl?
[06-15-2006 06:01:36] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> oh, i see, a package always overrwrite the "base" or "admin" desing, so it dont touch my changes, only that my changes could impide to see the new changes of the ackage
[06-15-2006 06:01:42] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i understand
[06-15-2006 06:03:25] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i think its an error, because a package must add a new desing, galklery for example, and put gallery over design int the priority defined in settings
[06-15-2006 06:04:41] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> jeremiah: arent the gallery templates are already part of the base-design?
[06-15-2006 06:05:29] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i dont know, but to learn i installed the corporate_site, and looking know the gallery package it modied the "base", its an error i think
[06-15-2006 06:06:01] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> do you think its correct? the designs seem to have a chain of prioritiees defined in a var inside settings
[06-15-2006 06:06:14] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> so why not to insert the package in this chain
[06-15-2006 06:06:18] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> they have a priority yes
[06-15-2006 06:06:37] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> if a package tocuh the base is dangerous
[06-15-2006 06:08:11] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_8/concepts_and_basics/designs/design_combinations
[06-15-2006 06:08:37] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> yes i see
[06-15-2006 06:08:39] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> base is the functionality of the standard packages, so you should not change that yourself
[06-15-2006 06:08:44] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> yes
[06-15-2006 06:08:57] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> and why a package touch it?
[06-15-2006 06:09:11] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> change it
[06-15-2006 06:10:22] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah>  <override-list>
[06-15-2006 06:10:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> - <block name="full_folder" site-access="base">
[06-15-2006 06:10:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> - <full_folder Source="node/view/full.tpl" MatchFile="full/folder.tpl" Subdir="templates">

[06-15-2006 06:10:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah>   </block>
[06-15-2006 06:10:42] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> it seems in this package that overwrite files in the base design
[06-15-2006 06:11:27] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> it could do it defining a new desing and inserting the templates and settings iin the chain corectly
[06-15-2006 06:12:26] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> if i cant modify a base, a package cant also.
[06-15-2006 06:12:34] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> do ypou think so?
[06-15-2006 06:14:07] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> the overridelist is the rules that goes in /settings/siteaccess/corporate/override.ini.append.php

[06-15-2006 06:14:53] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> there is a difference between 3.7 and 3.8 with the packages
[06-15-2006 06:15:09] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> but do you think like me?
[06-15-2006 06:15:09] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> in 3.7 and below all the functionality was in the base dir when you installed
[06-15-2006 06:15:24] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> it has changed in 3.8, so i am not shure how it works now...
[06-15-2006 06:15:28] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> aha, so this packages are old now?
[06-15-2006 06:15:46] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> so before 3.7 the design/base was not changed at all..
[06-15-2006 06:16:39] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i will install a gallery packge and see a diff of the directories, before and after
[06-15-2006 06:16:45] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i will go to eat now
