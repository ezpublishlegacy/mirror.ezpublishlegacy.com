[06-04-2006 04:42:59] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> hi
[06-04-2006 04:43:08] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> <img src="{$node.object.data_map.my_image.content[image_size].full_path}" ... />
[06-04-2006 04:43:16] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> where i put the image in the article?
[06-04-2006 04:43:50] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i dont understand how to put an image inside an article and then referencing the image from a template
[06-04-2006 04:44:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> the default article class doesnt contain images i think
[06-04-2006 04:45:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> other than that, use {attribute_view_gui} for the image attribute
[06-04-2006 04:46:29] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> Thx buz, but sorry , i dont understand yet. Must i upload an image in object relations in an article? and then reference it from a template?
[06-04-2006 04:46:43] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i am trying to get articles with thumbnails
[06-04-2006 04:46:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> that wholly depends on what you're trying to do
[06-04-2006 04:47:15] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> the tipical list of articles with a thumbnail
[06-04-2006 04:47:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh in that case i'd probably add an image field to article
[06-04-2006 04:47:44] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> aha, thx buz
[06-04-2006 04:47:54] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i will try it
[06-04-2006 04:48:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> of course you can use object relation as well but that seems more complicated to me
[06-04-2006 04:48:25] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> yes, its more logical with a image field
[06-04-2006 04:49:42] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> buz, is possible to chamge the class article without use the ADmin Panel?
[06-04-2006 04:51:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> no
[06-04-2006 04:52:10] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> oh, its a pity i like i like to avoid the panel always i can, more like linux programmer than using a gui interface
[06-04-2006 04:52:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> it would be nice a .ini or .class file
[06-04-2006 04:52:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> well you could try hacking the sql database yourself
[06-04-2006 04:52:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> good luck with that
[06-04-2006 04:52:56] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> no buz, i dont know enought for that
[06-04-2006 04:53:46] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i am learning EZP only this week, trying to do a little page, if i finish it i will ask your opinion
[06-04-2006 04:59:24] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> sorry buz one thing more
[06-04-2006 04:59:42] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> I see editing the class article this field called Image:	7. Image [Object relation] (id:187)
[06-04-2006 05:00:47] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> could i use that and how reference the image
[06-04-2006 05:00:53] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> ?
[06-04-2006 05:06:27] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i understant that this atribute called Image refers to Attachments, if i could reference this Images and get the first image, i could use it like the thumbnail.
[06-04-2006 05:07:05] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> Buz how could i do that, do you have some idea to help me to search for how to do it?
[06-04-2006 05:23:38] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> buz, i have found the solution, thx
[06-04-2006 05:23:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure how standard object relation work
[06-04-2006 05:23:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> ah ok
[06-04-2006 05:24:00] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> thx buz, i founded a similar question in the forum
[06-04-2006 05:26:42] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i think ezpublish is too much fragmented in templates, overbloated tpl, in my page i am trying to reduce that

[06-04-2006 06:00:10] [#ezpublish] <zr1> anyone awake rise hands!
[06-04-2006 06:00:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> whx
[06-04-2006 06:00:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> y
[06-04-2006 06:00:31] [#ezpublish] * zr1 wields the fish.
[06-04-2006 06:01:11] [#ezpublish] <zr1> nah, its just good to see some life among the corpses
[06-04-2006 06:02:13] [#ezpublish] <zr1> think i grilled you on price/vat thing already.. do you think if i set ez guys to fire they will wake up?
[06-04-2006 06:25:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh i think it works in 3.8
[06-04-2006 06:25:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> with those special products anyway
[06-04-2006 06:41:00] [#ezpublish] <zr1> got it :)
[06-04-2006 06:43:22] [#ezpublish] <zr1> for benefit of those reading log someday, this is how to set vat: $data_text = $vatID . ',' . $vatIncluded; $price->setAttribute( 'data_text', $data_text );
[06-04-2006 06:44:14] [#ezpublish] <zr1> it seems that date_text acts as gateway to set more complex data but is of course totally undocumented.
