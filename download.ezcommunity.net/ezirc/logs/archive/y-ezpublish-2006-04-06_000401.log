[04-04-2006 08:56:19] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi
[04-04-2006 08:56:52] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> for ezuser account, I do not want any login, but I want the email be the user id ... How could I manage this?
[04-04-2006 08:58:40] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> the email works as the userid :-)
[04-04-2006 08:59:13] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but login is mandatory isn't it?
[04-04-2006 08:59:55] [#ezpublish] <phretor> any way to modify the Author type in order to allow empty e-mail sub-fields?
[04-04-2006 09:00:13] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I don't want to ask for a login
[04-04-2006 09:21:11] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> you need to have a login yes.. but you can just generate random ids, and let the users use their email-address to log in.
[04-04-2006 09:23:27] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kris10an: what about my question on the Author type?
[04-04-2006 09:24:59] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> offcourse that can be done
[04-04-2006 09:27:11] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kris10an: note that if an attribute of type Author is marked as required, both Name and e-mail are required subfields. Would it require some hacks?
[04-04-2006 09:32:13] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> you can offcourse modify that to do something like this... i would recommend to create a new datatype in an extension, otherwise upgrading will be harder..
[04-04-2006 09:34:38] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kris10an: thanks, nice tip! :-) I've heard about the use of the extension system for providing new designs in a more "self contained" way. How about that?
