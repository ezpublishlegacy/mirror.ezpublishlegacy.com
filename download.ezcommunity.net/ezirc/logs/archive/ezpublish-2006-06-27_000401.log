[06-26-2006 02:32:34] [#ezpublish] <xigle1> strange that they didn't report the book as a news

[06-26-2006 03:55:59] [#ezpublish] <xigle1> just posted som feature request for 3.9
[06-26-2006 03:56:18] [#ezpublish] <xigle1> really hope that you do a remake of the default styles soon
[06-26-2006 03:56:21] -!- xigle1 is now known as xigleth
[06-26-2006 03:56:44] [#ezpublish] <xigleth> My guess would be that a lot of people get scared of the boring default styles
[06-26-2006 03:57:08] [#ezpublish] <xigleth> I guess they stops allready after the demo sites at ez.no
[06-26-2006 03:57:29] [#ezpublish] <xigleth> the "intranet solution" packages however, is very good (but not finished :( )
[06-26-2006 03:59:00] [#ezpublish] <xigleth> ordnas: haven't read the whole article yet but looks good!
[06-26-2006 03:59:48] [#ezpublish] <xigleth> The "build your first ezpublish site" from the old documentation site was really good, probably the article I learned best from
[06-26-2006 04:15:35] [#ezpublish] <zrg> user site templates are horrible, thats true

[06-26-2006 08:05:54] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi there
[06-26-2006 08:06:06] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I have a little problem with ViewCaching
[06-26-2006 08:06:16] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> on my site I have products
[06-26-2006 08:06:27] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> prices vary in function of users groups
[06-26-2006 08:06:58] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but when I activate the viewCaching there price doesn't update
[06-26-2006 08:07:04] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> how can I resolve this ?
[06-26-2006 08:12:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> hmm
[06-26-2006 08:13:45] [#ezpublish] <zrg> there is something called smart viewcaching
[06-26-2006 08:15:25] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i guess it could be used to for example turn off viewcaching for product class page, after which you could put cache-block around product full view template and set logged in user group id as part of cache block key
[06-26-2006 08:15:36] [#ezpublish] <zrg> just a idea
[06-26-2006 08:20:53] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> at least I would like to disabled viewCaching for products
[06-26-2006 08:21:03] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> even if it is not a good solution at all !
[06-26-2006 08:22:02] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I assume I can manage this in viewcache.ini right ?
[06-26-2006 08:23:10] [#ezpublish] <zrg> look up smart viewcaching in docs or forums
[06-26-2006 08:23:35] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> i will

[06-26-2006 08:24:47] [#ezpublish] <philG> hi all
[06-26-2006 08:25:12] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have a qst, i want insert an application in ezp solution, this solution is a perl solution
[06-26-2006 08:25:28] [#ezpublish] <philG> how include the page of this solution in the site ( template etc)
[06-26-2006 08:25:54] [#ezpublish] <philG> this solution is perlperfect
[06-26-2006 08:32:13] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> humm ... seems not so obvious to exclude a class from the viewcache
