[04-28-2005 14:17:13] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> What's actually the case with js and ez publish. Is it possible to include a javascript in the pagelayout.tpl with a reference like this?  <script language="JavaScript" src="/design/cc/stylesheets/wtrends.js"></script>
[04-28-2005 14:17:39] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> I need to implement a webtrends script to post data from the ez site to another server
[04-28-2005 14:17:54] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> but nothing happends
[04-28-2005 14:18:16] [#ezpublish] <_luke> yes
[04-28-2005 14:18:16] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> I get no data
[04-28-2005 14:18:30] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> This is the correct way, isn't it`?
[04-28-2005 14:18:44] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> and I have placed the script in design/cc/stylesheets/
[04-28-2005 14:18:46] [#ezpublish] <_luke> <script language="JavaScript" src={"js/wtrends.js"|ezdesign}>
[04-28-2005 14:18:47] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> hmm
[04-28-2005 14:18:55] [#ezpublish] <_luke> makee dir js under design folder
[04-28-2005 14:19:19] [#ezpublish] <_luke> design folder for your site of course
[04-28-2005 14:19:27] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> I got a dir design/sitedesign/stylesheet/
[04-28-2005 14:19:37] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> and want to place the js file in the stylesheet folder
[04-28-2005 14:19:37] [#ezpublish] <_luke> design/(your_design)/js
[04-28-2005 14:19:43] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> then  <script language="JavaScript" src="/design/cc/stylesheets/wtrends.js"></script>
[04-28-2005 14:19:47] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> this must be right
[04-28-2005 14:19:53] [#ezpublish] <_luke> <script language="JavaScript" src={"stylesheets/wtrends.js"|ezdesign}>
[04-28-2005 14:20:00] [#ezpublish] <_luke> should works
[04-28-2005 14:20:07] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> but why don't  <script language="JavaScript" src="/design/cc/stylesheets/wtrends.js"></script> work
[04-28-2005 14:20:09] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> ?
[04-28-2005 14:20:10] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> ;)

[04-28-2005 14:20:24] [#ezpublish] <_luke> <script language="JavaScript" src={"stylesheets/wtrends.js"|ezdesign}> -> more flexibile
[04-28-2005 14:20:35] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> yes, but  <script language="JavaScript" src="/design/cc/stylesheets/wtrends.js"></script> shuld also work or`?
[04-28-2005 14:20:45] [#ezpublish] <_luke> yep
[04-28-2005 14:20:49] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> but it don't
[04-28-2005 14:21:02] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> so I guess the other solution wont work either
[04-28-2005 14:21:05] [#ezpublish] <_luke> you have ezpublish in root folder
[04-28-2005 14:21:05] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> hmm

[04-28-2005 14:21:32] [#ezpublish] <_luke> or

[04-28-2005 14:21:47] [#ezpublish] <Zetnix> yup
[04-28-2005 14:21:57] [#ezpublish] <_luke> the last one?
