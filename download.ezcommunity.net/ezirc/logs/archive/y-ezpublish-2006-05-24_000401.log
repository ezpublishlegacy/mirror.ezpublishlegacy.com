[05-22-2006 03:51:27] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> one of my client wants to be able to colorize some part of text in the Online Editor ... How would you do this ?
[05-22-2006 03:54:32] [#ezpublish] <katana`> colorize as in... ?
[05-22-2006 03:54:34] [#ezpublish] <katana`> show with colors ?
[05-22-2006 03:54:39] [#ezpublish] <katana`> or set colors...
[05-22-2006 03:55:40] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> set colors
[05-22-2006 03:56:25] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I figure that the goal is to generate a kind of <span style="color:#colhex">...</span> ...
[05-22-2006 03:56:36] [#ezpublish] <katana`> ah
[05-22-2006 03:56:43] [#ezpublish] <katana`> maybe with literal tags ?
[05-22-2006 03:57:24] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> didn't think about this solution
[05-22-2006 03:58:45] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but will be hard to explain to my client ...
[05-22-2006 04:01:16] [#ezpublish] <katana`> might be yes...
[05-22-2006 04:01:22] [#ezpublish] <katana`> with a custom tag maybe ?
[05-22-2006 04:02:13] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes, but custom tag seems not very usable for this kind of stuff
[05-22-2006 04:03:01] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I think I will use custom tags for the moment and will make a suggestion, to add a new button to the OE, that will allow user to change text color
[05-22-2006 04:19:52] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> *shivers*
[05-22-2006 04:21:08] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> If that button is added to OE I would never upgrade
[05-22-2006 04:21:58] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> why?
[05-22-2006 04:22:03] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> _maybe_ if I could set a predefined set of colors...
[05-22-2006 04:23:14] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> because I know content editors would make the site look horrible....
[05-22-2006 04:24:03] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes you are right, but sometimes you have to make your client happy with stupid things
[05-22-2006 04:25:33] [#ezpublish] <katana`> hehe...
[05-22-2006 04:25:36] [#ezpublish] <katana`> sometimes ? :)

[05-22-2006 13:46:13] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I'we done a $keys=fetch....., then foreach $keys as $key....  then {section show=$key.object.data_map.<checkbox-attribute>.is_empty|not} test {/section}. Shouldn't this work? It should print "test" if the checkbox is checked
[05-22-2006 13:49:16] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> i'll try to find the "new" way anyway ...
[05-22-2006 14:08:06] [#ezpublish] <ls> this is not a good idea to mix old and new syntax, use {if key.object.data_map.<checkbox-attribute>.data_int} should be suficient
[05-22-2006 14:08:46] [#ezpublish] <ls> you should follow one style in your templates
[05-22-2006 14:11:08] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> Yeah I know, but as a part of my learning process I look at some existing templates .. and unfortunately there is a lot of old syntaxes in ezpublish still :(
[05-22-2006 14:11:37] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I talked to Allman today, he said the book would be released this summer :) yippi!

[05-22-2006 14:53:06] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ls: I can see you have used some old syntax in your intranet solution :)
[05-22-2006 14:54:10] [#ezpublish] <ls> yeah might be, perhaps old habits, using eZp since 3.2, you know
[05-22-2006 14:54:32] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> :) forgiven ;-)

[05-22-2006 14:58:00] [#ezpublish] <ls> this is great, we need more ppl like you :P
[05-22-2006 15:02:40] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> :) I hope that I can be able to help people as well in the future .. And I hope people can help me now when I'm learning this. If I feel that I have learned enough to deliver sites to costumers at the end of this year, we'll become a eZ partner

[05-22-2006 15:05:15] [#ezpublish] <ls> great, there is a lot of very useful information on the forum just you need to be patient and search
[05-22-2006 15:06:09] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> yes, have done it already
[05-22-2006 15:06:20] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> will spend a lot of time there in the future I guess :)
[05-22-2006 15:08:03] [#ezpublish] <Allman> so, are you guys coming to the summer conference?
[05-22-2006 15:08:16] [#ezpublish] <Allman> you should, even Pet Shop Boys are coming to town...
[05-22-2006 15:08:33] [#ezpublish] <Allman> they'll probably stay at the same hotel as the eZ conf. attendees :)
[05-22-2006 15:08:50] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I wish
[05-22-2006 15:10:02] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> cool! I asked my boss but he had to say no .. we had to make some money with ez publish soon he said .. :)
[05-22-2006 15:10:16] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> some cash in too, not only cash out
[05-22-2006 15:10:47] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I guess the only costs is the course that you hold Allman .. A very good one if I may say ;-)

[05-22-2006 15:13:00] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I certainly did, me and Truls .. But we spend a lot of time making layout (xhtml/css) look nice in all browsers :) Should have a dedicated designer
[05-22-2006 15:13:19] [#ezpublish] <Allman> ah yes, that's what ppl usually spend time on..
[05-22-2006 15:13:23] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> We were the first course at your new locates in Oslo
[05-22-2006 15:13:34] [#ezpublish] * awormus is coming!!!

[05-22-2006 15:15:40] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> Allman: I also wrote to the Farstad brothers and said that this was probably the best course we've participated in
[05-22-2006 15:15:50] [#ezpublish] <Allman> cool :)
[05-22-2006 15:16:19] [#ezpublish] <ls> powered by Allman :)

[05-22-2006 15:17:04] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> only one annoying thing was that guy that thought he ruled the world
[05-22-2006 15:17:33] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> we used half of the time answering his irrelevant questions .. :)
[05-22-2006 15:17:55] [#ezpublish] <Allman> ah, yeah.. there is always at least one such guy.. :)
[05-22-2006 15:18:00] [#ezpublish] <Allman> you just have to ignore him..
[05-22-2006 15:18:19] [#ezpublish] <Allman> problem is the WoT factor (waste of time)
[05-22-2006 15:20:27] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> absolutely :) well, done is done .. should have put something in his coffee but it's too late now :)
[05-22-2006 15:21:53] [#ezpublish] <ls> what that guy did?
[05-22-2006 15:22:08] [#ezpublish] <zrg> is there anyplace where i can get a rough idea what do these courses go through?
[05-22-2006 15:22:34] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> it looked like he just asked "complex questions" to point out his intelligence  or something
[05-22-2006 15:22:50] [#ezpublish] <Allman> hehe, yeap.. cool guy :)
[05-22-2006 15:23:06] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> you remenber him Allman ?

[05-22-2006 15:51:18] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> that's why all norwegians drink tons of liquor BEFORE going out
[05-22-2006 15:51:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ferry from tallinn to stockholm is quite a view, full of drunk swedes ;)
[05-22-2006 15:51:57] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> swede chicks are great
