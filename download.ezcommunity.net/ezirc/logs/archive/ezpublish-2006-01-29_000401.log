[01-28-2006 13:20:04] [#ezpublish] * buz needs help
[01-28-2006 13:20:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> on one of my sites, my wiki extension fails in a utterly weird way:
[01-28-2006 13:20:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> error is
[01-28-2006 13:20:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> Could not find module named 'projects'
[01-28-2006 13:20:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> These directories were tried none of them exists:
[01-28-2006 13:20:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> kernel/projects, extension/advancedforum/modules/projects, extension/owner/modules/projects, extension/wiki/modules/projects, extension/ezpaypal/modules/projects
[01-28-2006 13:20:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> but there is no reference to a "projects" extension whatsoever to be found?!?
[01-28-2006 13:24:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think the content tree is fucked up
[01-28-2006 13:29:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> for one reason or another site/wiki redirects to some wikiobject way further down the tree???
[01-28-2006 13:32:36] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no idea, sorry
[01-28-2006 13:32:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> any way to regenerate the content tree?
[01-28-2006 13:33:14] [#ezpublish] <zrg> from what? :)
[01-28-2006 13:33:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> good point ;)
[01-28-2006 13:34:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont get it
[01-28-2006 13:34:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> HTTP/1.x 301 Moved Permanently
[01-28-2006 13:34:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> ez delivers a
[01-28-2006 13:34:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> when i try to access the module base url?
[01-28-2006 13:34:47] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i'd first do, in site root:
[01-28-2006 13:34:47] [#ezpublish] <zrg> grep -r -i projects settings
[01-28-2006 13:34:47] [#ezpublish] <zrg> grep -r -i projects extensions
[01-28-2006 13:34:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> did that already
[01-28-2006 13:34:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> doesnt help
[01-28-2006 13:35:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, just had to suggest :)
[01-28-2006 13:35:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> it would seem like there is some redirect going on
[01-28-2006 13:35:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> but i cant figure out why
[01-28-2006 13:35:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> url translation is not active
[01-28-2006 13:35:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> waait..
[01-28-2006 13:35:47] [#ezpublish] <zrg> several siteaccesses?
[01-28-2006 13:36:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> just admin and regular
[01-28-2006 13:36:38] [#ezpublish] <zrg> cant acess in admin too?
[01-28-2006 13:38:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> same weird redirect
[01-28-2006 13:38:16] [#ezpublish] <buz> you can try it on triligon.org
[01-28-2006 13:38:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> hit triligon.org/wiki and see what happens
[01-28-2006 13:38:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> beyond understanding
[01-28-2006 13:40:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> gets weirder
[01-28-2006 13:40:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> i cant remove the object it redirects to
[01-28-2006 13:42:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> or anything at all on the site, really
[01-28-2006 13:42:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> WTF is going on
[01-28-2006 13:44:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> it just silently doesnt do anything
[01-28-2006 13:48:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> seems to work, wheres error?
[01-28-2006 13:48:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> the fact that you end up on a page not with an error message
[01-28-2006 13:48:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> now the admin interface is broken as well
[01-28-2006 13:48:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> whatever i acecss, i always get the same page
[01-28-2006 13:49:22] [#ezpublish] <zrg> http://triligon.org/triligon/projects/xinha_and_ezxhtml/ezxhtml_wiki/sandbox
[01-28-2006 13:49:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah try to create an object
[01-28-2006 13:49:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> its totally fucked up
[01-28-2006 13:49:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> whatever link i click i always get the same admin interface page
[01-28-2006 13:51:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> need login to create anything i guess but browsing is ok
[01-28-2006 13:51:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> i doubt that works
[01-28-2006 13:51:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> i cant do anything with the admin interface now
[01-28-2006 13:51:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> wtf
[01-28-2006 13:52:14] [#ezpublish] <zrg> doubt what works
[01-28-2006 13:52:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> even updated 3.6.4 to 3.6.5 now nothing works
[01-28-2006 13:53:24] [#ezpublish] <zrg> please be more specific, site works ok for me
[01-28-2006 13:53:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah frontend works
[01-28-2006 13:53:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> but whatever link i click on the backend, i always end up on the page i started
[01-28-2006 13:53:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> no error no nothing but it doesnt do a thing
[01-28-2006 13:54:19] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i once got error like this with corruptioin in url alias table
[01-28-2006 13:54:52] [#ezpublish] <zrg> wonder if i filed bug..
[01-28-2006 13:56:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok there lives stuff in that table that should NOT BE THERE
[01-28-2006 13:57:36] [#ezpublish] <zrg> somehow line in style of * -> somepage had got there
[01-28-2006 13:59:35] [#ezpublish] <zrg> http://ez.no/community/bugs/ezurlalias_table_entry_wrong
[01-28-2006 14:00:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah something like that happened as well
[01-28-2006 14:01:45] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i suggest: clean cache (manually), turn on sql debugging, request page, go over log line by line
[01-28-2006 14:01:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> i deleted all wildcards from the table
[01-28-2006 14:02:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> lets see what happens
[01-28-2006 14:02:06] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it will reveal what is going on
[01-28-2006 14:02:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no need to tell you make backups first i guess :P
[01-28-2006 14:02:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> can only do sqldump
[01-28-2006 14:03:02] [#ezpublish] <zrg> good enough
[01-28-2006 14:07:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> http://pastebin.com/527769 wtf
[01-28-2006 14:16:16] [#ezpublish] <zrg> shit in urlrewrite, no?
[01-28-2006 14:16:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> never changed it
[01-28-2006 14:19:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i'd be interested in results of those sql
[01-28-2006 14:26:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> look at the pastebin
[01-28-2006 14:26:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> it looks like i can navigate the tree in admin menu
[01-28-2006 14:26:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> but not access anything other than that
[01-28-2006 14:38:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont get it
[01-28-2006 14:38:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> why are the other modules seemingly not working at all
