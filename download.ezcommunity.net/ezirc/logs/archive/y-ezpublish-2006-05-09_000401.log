[05-07-2006 03:36:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> is there a way to put a link into the leftmenu that directly jumps to the target url?
[05-07-2006 03:36:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> not to link object first?
[05-07-2006 03:43:23] [#ezpublish] <_kore> Give the class you use for the navigation an extra attribute like 'external_url' and, if set, use this as the URL in the navigation
[05-07-2006 03:43:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> well that still means i have to hack the menu template yes?
[05-07-2006 03:44:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> i could simply put the url in there myself then (it's static)
[05-07-2006 03:44:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> i want to put a link to user/login in the tree menu
[05-07-2006 03:44:28] [#ezpublish] <_kore> You could add a rewrite rule...
[05-07-2006 03:44:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> i rather just change the template then ;)
[05-07-2006 03:46:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> or maybe i hack the treemenu to use a new node view treemenu...
[05-07-2006 03:46:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> that would have it advantages anyway
