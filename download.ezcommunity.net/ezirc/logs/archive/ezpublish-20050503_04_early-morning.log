[18:21] <rw> hi
[18:21] <kracker> hey!
[18:21] <rw> I just installed it my system, I was used to mambo! Ez Publish is great!
[18:21] <rw> the translation feature (aka mambelfish in mambo) isn't that good.
[18:21] <rw> in ez publish is awesome!
[18:22] <kracker> cool. sho nuff
[18:22] <rw> I am just having a hard time to find how to add option in the main page so the user can choose from all the translated languages, right now two. Any idea?
[18:23] <kracker> so what are you going to do with eZ publish
[18:23] <rw> right now it will be a website for my "brother"
[18:24] <rw> which died almost 2 years ago. His father created an organization to help people.
[18:24] <kracker> Weeeelll, that's a good question
[18:24] <rw> hehehe
[18:24] <kracker> i think you need to manually add links into your pagelayout 
[18:25] <rw> i've just installed, I think I will test it a little bit more before doing a theme.
[18:25] <kracker> like http://ez.no/ has 3 in the top right and side
[18:25] <kracker> nods
[18:25] <rw> yeah! true I see
[18:26] <kracker> i don't think eZ publish currently has a drop down / auto gen list of per item translations.
[18:26] <rw> not really important to me, add links it's ok...
[18:27] <kracker> If I were you, and I was really intersted in that kind of functionality I would first (search ez.no via google for lots of possible keywords) and if you can't find a past thread that answeres your question, simply start a new thread and refernece any past relevant threads along with a very detailed description of what you would like to know how to accomplish.
[18:27] <kracker> hehe
[18:28] <kracker> as i throw myself out with the bathwater ..
[18:28] <kracker> still, it's what I would do ...
[18:28] <rw> yeah I will do it...
[18:28] <kracker> i think that someone has even asked this question before ...
[18:28] <kracker> but ... i don't recall a stand up solution but I could have missed the bus ...
[20:40] * kracker smirk
[21:06] <kracker> sweet
[21:06] <kracker> wait a second, i'm still playing catchup arn't i ...
