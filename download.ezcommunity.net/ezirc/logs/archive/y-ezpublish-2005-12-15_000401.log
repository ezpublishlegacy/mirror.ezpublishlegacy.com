[12-13-2005 14:46:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> how can i add functions to a class defined in the backend? Is there an apropriate documentation to this topic?

[12-13-2005 15:38:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> buz: i want to implement a push technique: when an article is published on a extern system this article should be send to the ezpublish site which includes the article_id what becomes a remote_article_id in the ezpublish site. so when its exported to the ezpublish-site the article should be automatically published and further the remote_article_id should be set as an object attribute of the new instantiated object within eZ-
