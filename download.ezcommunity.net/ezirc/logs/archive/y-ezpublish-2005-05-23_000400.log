[05-21-2005 00:08:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then he turned inside (you can always tell when they turn...sometimes before they even know themselves)

[05-21-2005 00:35:23] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> php was supposed to make web programming easier... now there's 200 frameworks that are supposed to make php easier...... too much choice
[05-21-2005 00:35:29] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> need apple programming language that just works
[05-21-2005 00:36:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so true
[05-21-2005 00:37:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but what works is so circumstancial and subject to the flux, once you agree someone smarter has already eclipsed your monument to the folly of man

[05-21-2005 15:22:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> or a lawyer
[05-21-2005 15:23:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> professors is probably more relaxed
