[11-25-2005 06:43:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> does that mean images and the like as well? that would rock
[11-25-2005 06:43:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> also templates etc?
[11-25-2005 06:47:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> kracker: that's what i had determined :)
[11-25-2005 06:47:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i had to check on urbandictionnary.com though ^^
[11-25-2005 06:49:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yay new beta of PHPEdit 2
[11-25-2005 07:10:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> but no ajax demo i take it?

[11-25-2005 07:23:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the camera was misconfigured ;)
[11-25-2005 07:23:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> buz: i have published a demo yesterday...

[11-25-2005 07:23:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> woohooo
[11-25-2005 07:24:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and yes the appartment is really good looking ;)
[11-25-2005 07:24:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> (not many features yet)
[11-25-2005 07:25:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok i can navigate the tree
[11-25-2005 07:25:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> but nothing else?
[11-25-2005 07:25:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> o i must doubleclick
[11-25-2005 07:25:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yes doubleclick should work as well
[11-25-2005 07:26:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've added the contextual menu on my version
[11-25-2005 07:26:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> view works, same as doubleclick, and i'm working on remove
[11-25-2005 07:26:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> neat
[11-25-2005 07:26:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> toolbar would be cool
[11-25-2005 07:26:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm also gonna try something for that logon screen
[11-25-2005 07:26:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what would you put in there ?
[11-25-2005 07:26:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> (toolbar or menubar ?)
[11-25-2005 07:26:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> something aking to whats currently in the top menu
[11-25-2005 07:26:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> but DYNAMIC
[11-25-2005 07:26:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> not that current overly weird crap
[11-25-2005 07:26:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[11-25-2005 07:27:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> really, it's beyond understanding what that's supposed to do
[11-25-2005 07:27:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> which one do you mean ? content / settings / shop, etc or preview, locations ... ?
[11-25-2005 07:27:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> content etc
[11-25-2005 07:27:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah
[11-25-2005 07:27:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> sounds pretty standard to me ... they're supposed to be tabs i think :)
[11-25-2005 07:27:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[11-25-2005 07:27:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> but did you ever look under the hood?
[11-25-2005 07:27:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's where the weirdness resides
[11-25-2005 07:28:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> a bit yes... it's indeed beyond human comprehension :)
[11-25-2005 07:28:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> tons of ini settings and nothing i change has any impact :)
[11-25-2005 07:28:16] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[11-25-2005 07:28:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> and hacking code has weird impact
[11-25-2005 07:28:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-25-2005 07:28:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i was planning on adding a menu bar
[11-25-2005 07:28:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> the menu done as proper dropdown menu would rock
[11-25-2005 07:28:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but i'm not sure what i'd put in here :)
[11-25-2005 07:29:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> the stuff that gets listed in the left menu for setup etc
[11-25-2005 07:29:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> i.e. shortcuts
[11-25-2005 07:29:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> i had it once
[11-25-2005 07:29:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> but it looked ugly as hell
[11-25-2005 07:31:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> http://qooxdoo.oss.schlund.de/demo/release/public/test/user/Menubar_1.html ?
[11-25-2005 07:32:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh the font after double click is fugly on linux
[11-25-2005 07:33:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah like that
[11-25-2005 08:17:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> Katana`: did you try displaying many wigets? how's the speed on that?
[11-25-2005 08:17:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no idea yet :)
[11-25-2005 08:17:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the tree already has quite a few of them
[11-25-2005 08:17:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe i could use qooxdoo to build a calendar ;)
[11-25-2005 08:18:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hehe maybe yes :)
[11-25-2005 08:18:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> their JS api is REALLY nice
[11-25-2005 08:18:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> or is there already an ajax widget for that SOMEWHERE
[11-25-2005 08:18:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you can extend classes, add properties (and it automatically adds the setters and getters) ...
[11-25-2005 08:18:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> (ok zimbra obviously got one but that thing is gigantic)
[11-25-2005 08:18:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it seems that you can download the package and extract the JS part
[11-25-2005 08:18:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's distinct and should even be released as an opensource component sooner or later
[11-25-2005 08:36:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'd really prefer a calendar that works in konqi and safari tho

[11-25-2005 08:50:36] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> I don't think he's allowed to do that w/o configuring his roles... but then agian, I might be wrong

[11-25-2005 08:53:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> htf could a anon user save his cart???
[11-25-2005 08:53:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> you wouldhave to save the complete cart into the cookie
[11-25-2005 08:53:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> a persistant one, even
[11-25-2005 08:53:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> which many browser even allow

[11-25-2005 08:56:23] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> buz it's not exactly a cart but "my selection"
[11-25-2005 08:56:45] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> so when the user comeback he can get his selection
[11-25-2005 08:56:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think that can really be done
[11-25-2005 08:57:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> you could do an extension likely
[11-25-2005 08:57:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> saving the cart as cookie on the users machine and reloading it from there
[11-25-2005 08:57:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> but i'm not sure if that is even th ebest idea
[11-25-2005 08:58:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> personally, i'd state "please register if you want to have persistant carts"
[11-25-2005 08:58:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> so people have a benefit for registering

[11-25-2005 13:11:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> but JSP is a really sorry implementation of the concept
[11-25-2005 13:12:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> postgre otoh is a nice db
[11-25-2005 13:12:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> if only it had saner admin tools
[11-25-2005 13:12:12] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> well, you can use JAVA classes as well,
[11-25-2005 13:12:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> if you use java, use spring framework or something like that
[11-25-2005 13:12:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> stay away from EJB
[11-25-2005 13:12:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> but in general, there's jsut way too much setup work with java
[11-25-2005 13:12:47] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> no, JSP with Tomcat,
[11-25-2005 13:12:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> stuff like hibernate is killer though
[11-25-2005 13:12:58] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> you can crete java classes and use them
[11-25-2005 13:14:23] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> eZ componets will come next week
[11-25-2005 13:14:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> nice
[11-25-2005 13:14:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> will we get true ORM now?
[11-25-2005 13:14:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> ez ajax is missing ;)
[11-25-2005 13:14:49] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hehe
[11-25-2005 13:14:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> but our resident ajax freak might change that, ey?
[11-25-2005 13:15:15] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> that depends on Mt. fh
[11-25-2005 13:15:18] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> mr
[11-25-2005 13:15:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> WTF
[11-25-2005 13:15:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> new sf interface is even more painful to download stuff

[11-25-2005 14:10:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hey lukas
[11-25-2005 14:10:50] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hey Katana` :)
[11-25-2005 14:13:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> how are you doing ?
[11-25-2005 14:15:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> have you seen my ajax interface demo ls[eZ] ? :)
[11-25-2005 14:16:10] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> no?
[11-25-2005 14:16:26] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> show me :)
[11-25-2005 14:16:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> http://ajax.katana-inc.com/ login irc pass freenode
[11-25-2005 14:17:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> just a proof of concept but i'm working on it :)
[11-25-2005 14:20:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh those dhtml interfaces sure are neat
[11-25-2005 14:20:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> but kinda slow...
[11-25-2005 14:21:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> Katana`: what's the difference between widget and atom
[11-25-2005 14:22:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> good question :)
[11-25-2005 14:22:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i think a widget is visual while an atom is not
[11-25-2005 14:22:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> but atoms get displayed too in the demo?
[11-25-2005 14:22:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hum then i'm wrong :)
[11-25-2005 14:22:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> http://qooxdoo.oss.schlund.de/2005/07/10/features
[11-25-2005 14:22:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's explained
[11-25-2005 14:29:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh so it's something icon plus text
[11-25-2005 14:30:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> buz, seriously, slower than plain xhtml eZ interface ? :)
[11-25-2005 14:30:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and it seems that the current dev version is much faster
[11-25-2005 14:30:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually it shouldnt be that bad
[11-25-2005 14:30:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> once the toolkit is loaded
[11-25-2005 14:30:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> if you religiously do ajax it might work out to be ok
[11-25-2005 14:31:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> of course firefox will likely still leak memory
[11-25-2005 14:32:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-25-2005 14:32:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm okay with an interface that takes 15s to load then is ergonomic and fast
[11-25-2005 14:32:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> 15s is too long
[11-25-2005 14:32:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> <5s is ok i guess
[11-25-2005 14:33:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it was an extreme exemple;)
[11-25-2005 14:33:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh it sucks that i cant copy text?
[11-25-2005 14:33:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but it's not impossible imho
[11-25-2005 14:33:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> maybe there's an option ;)
[11-25-2005 14:33:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> probably
[11-25-2005 14:34:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hmm i don't think so ^^
[11-25-2005 14:34:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> but then there's the ugly "application may not use the clipboard" security feature
[11-25-2005 14:34:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but i see it more than a user interface or advanced user than an admin one
[11-25-2005 14:34:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> indeed
[11-25-2005 14:34:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> i mean i see the point
[11-25-2005 14:34:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> but i never actually managed to get it working with the workaround....
[11-25-2005 14:35:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah yes...
[11-25-2005 14:35:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> in that case... anyway any DHTML editor would be fucked so :)
[11-25-2005 14:35:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually those for parts can circumvent it
[11-25-2005 14:35:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> xinha and tinymce both do
[11-25-2005 14:35:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> dunno how
[11-25-2005 14:36:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> neither do I :)
[11-25-2005 14:36:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> maybe it has been circumvented by the qooxdoo guys as well
[11-25-2005 14:36:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> they really seem to be good:))
[11-25-2005 14:36:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think as long as you dont try to hijack the browser it works
[11-25-2005 14:37:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> JS gods
[11-25-2005 14:40:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> http://www.sinn-frei.com/exklusiv.php?bid=2137
[11-25-2005 14:45:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok so how do i get that to work (overlapping events side by side) http://img408.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picupload22gz.jpg
[11-25-2005 14:51:13] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol no idea

[11-25-2005 15:04:31] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> bon appetit
[11-25-2005 15:08:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> hmm if i steal an algorithm from a gpl program and port it to another language, am i still bound to the gpl?
[11-25-2005 15:10:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i don't think so
[11-25-2005 15:10:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> gpl applies for verbatim or derived works
[11-25-2005 15:10:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> but algorithms ported to other languages likely arent derived words
[11-25-2005 15:15:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> is there an activex plugin for ie that uses gecko for rendering? that would solve a lot of problems...
