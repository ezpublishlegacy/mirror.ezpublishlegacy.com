[05-11-2006 13:50:36] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> thx ls, i dont speak english very well, i woul like to insert things where i edit the content, for example if a put a tag {time } in the CONTENT, not in a tpl, then that time fetch for example a image from a web a put the image in my content, i dont now if i explain it well
[05-11-2006 13:51:12] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> how could i proçgram this tags than extend the content edition
[05-11-2006 13:51:30] [#ezpublish] <ls> us can use custom tags
[05-11-2006 13:51:41] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> aha, custom tags
[05-11-2006 13:52:02] [#ezpublish] <ls> http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_7/reference/xml_tags#custom_tags
[05-11-2006 13:52:08] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> i will look for documentation about that
[05-11-2006 13:52:10] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> oh, thx
[05-11-2006 13:52:26] [#ezpublish] <ls> yes, then you can display what you want in the output from custom tag
[05-11-2006 13:52:39] [#ezpublish] <ls> <custom name="mytag"></custom>
[05-11-2006 13:52:44] [#ezpublish] <ls> something like this
[05-11-2006 13:53:19] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> yes, thx ls, is just i was looking for
[05-11-2006 13:53:33] [#ezpublish] <ls> you are welcome :)
[05-11-2006 14:04:37] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> ls, sorry, exists a design xhtml strict 1.0 ?
[05-11-2006 14:05:29] [#ezpublish] <ls> yes
[05-11-2006 14:06:58] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> well i will look in the ez.no to try it
[05-11-2006 14:07:43] [#ezpublish] <ls> what so you mean by design xhtml strict? eZ publish templates follows xhtml transitional DTD
[05-11-2006 14:09:30] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> yes, i refer if exist a design that override the standar and make Ez Publish to validate as xhtml strict
[05-11-2006 14:15:36] [#ezpublish] <ls> no, eZ publish templates are valide with xhtml transitional not strict
[05-11-2006 14:17:58] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> but i suppose that if i change the templatesm the pagelayout etc, it validate ok in strict, no?

[05-11-2006 14:44:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> probably not
[05-11-2006 14:44:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> unless you really check ALL the templates you use
[05-11-2006 14:44:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> which would be a herculean job
[05-11-2006 14:44:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> you might have a specific reason for strict, but if it isnt a really good one i wouldnt burden myself with it
[05-11-2006 14:45:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> btw, is anyone from ez north america here?
[05-11-2006 14:46:32] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> well i will check all the templates in the design i do if i decide to use EP
[05-11-2006 14:46:36] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> thx buz
[05-11-2006 14:47:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> be aware that it is HUNDREDS of templates

[05-11-2006 14:48:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> could still be in the low hundreds
[05-11-2006 14:50:15] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> hundred is 100?, i think if is 100, is factible, but i will reduce to the minimun, of course, all the way i am learning a little of EzPublih, i an decidin Ezpublish vs BitWeaver this days
[05-11-2006 14:50:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> bitweaver i've never heard of
[05-11-2006 14:51:25] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> bw is good, xhtml strict, but habe another problems, well, i will learn ep and decide
[05-11-2006 14:55:54] [#ezpublish] <alvaro-> bitweaver is tikiwiki, but a fork to convert it object oriented and modular, i like it, but i like also EP and want to learn it, so this week i will stay in this chanel learning
