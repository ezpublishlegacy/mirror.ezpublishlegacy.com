[05-16-2005 11:20:13] [#ezpublish] <mike_> Hi.
[05-16-2005 11:21:24] [#ezpublish] <mike_> I'm having a "AcceptPathInfo" problem when trying to install EzPublish 3.5.2 on Apache 2.0.54-r4 (gentoo package)
[05-16-2005 11:21:59] [#ezpublish] <mike_> I've tried adding the directive in the directory section for "/", as well is in the general server config, with seemingly no effect.
[05-16-2005 11:24:06] [#ezpublish] <xbit> remembered restarting?
[05-16-2005 11:24:56] [#ezpublish] <mike_> Indeed.

[05-16-2005 11:33:00] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> gettinh any specific error msgs/logs?
[05-16-2005 11:33:09] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> s/h/g/
[05-16-2005 11:33:32] [#ezpublish] <mike_> no, looked at the error log but nothing related to this is there.
[05-16-2005 11:33:46] [#ezpublish] <mike_> It's almost like it's just not seeing it, sort of. No error, just ezpub complains.
[05-16-2005 11:34:05] [#ezpublish] <mike_> I'm probably doing something stupid out of ignorance, but I don't see what.
[05-16-2005 11:35:41] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> haven't really ran into that problem... sorry
[05-16-2005 11:37:42] [#ezpublish] <mike_> no problem, thanks for trying.
[05-16-2005 11:38:10] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> tried searching the site in google? http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=site:ez.no+acceptpathinfo&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
[05-16-2005 11:38:29] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> err http://www.google.com/search?q=site:ez.no+acceptpathinfo
[05-16-2005 11:39:56] [#ezpublish] <mike_> must admit, I didn't search this site specifically, but I shall do so now.
[05-16-2005 11:50:02] [#ezpublish] <mike_> I did a phpinfo() page, and it's picking up the path_info env variable.
[05-16-2005 11:50:11] [#ezpublish] <mike_> So apache itself seems to be taking it fine.
[05-16-2005 12:04:26] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> you did phpinfo inside the same dir as ezpub?
[05-16-2005 12:07:43] [#ezpublish] <mike_> yeah.
[05-16-2005 12:08:40] [#ezpublish] <mike_> to be exact, for the URL "http://192.168.6.203/ezpub/phpinfo.php/test/something/else", the PATH_INFO env variable is "/test/something/else"
[05-16-2005 12:09:13] [#ezpublish] <mike_> and PHP's "_SERVER["PATH_INFO"]" is the same.
[05-16-2005 12:11:44] [#ezpublish] <mike_> alright, before I finish tackling this problem, I think I'll tackle some lunch.
[05-16-2005 12:12:00] [#ezpublish] <mike_> Thanks for the help, I'll be around again after a bit if anything comes to mind.
[05-16-2005 12:21:30] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> a'ight np... not sure what ezpub's problem is...
[05-16-2005 12:47:10] [#ezpublish] <mike_> I return.
[05-16-2005 12:53:27] [#ezpublish] <mike_> I don't suppose I could just check "skip this check", eh?
[05-16-2005 12:53:39] [#ezpublish] <mike_> 'Ignore this test", rather
[05-16-2005 13:02:01] [#ezpublish] <mike_> seems like this is a common problem, but no one ever goes back and posts the solution once they get it working.
[05-16-2005 13:02:04] [#ezpublish] <mike_> I hate when people do that.
[05-16-2005 13:37:48] [#ezpublish] <mike_> alright, I just skipped that test
[05-16-2005 13:37:56] [#ezpublish] <mike_> seems to be working fine anyway
[05-16-2005 13:38:05] [#ezpublish] <mike_> meh. I'll call it a fluke and leave it at that.
[05-16-2005 13:38:08] [#ezpublish] <mike_> hehe.
[05-16-2005 13:38:14] [#ezpublish] <mike_> Thanks for the help, lal
