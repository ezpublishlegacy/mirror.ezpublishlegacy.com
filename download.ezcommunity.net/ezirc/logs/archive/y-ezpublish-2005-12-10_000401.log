[12-08-2005 06:42:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> 14
[12-08-2005 07:36:20] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> that much?
[12-08-2005 07:36:37] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> I think they'd have difficulties reaching even 6
[12-08-2005 07:36:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-08-2005 07:36:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> how many angels can dance on a pinhead ?
[12-08-2005 07:37:14] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> depends on the size of the angels.. DUUH
[12-08-2005 07:37:15] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> :)
[12-08-2005 07:37:40] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> and on the size of the pinhead as well of course
[12-08-2005 07:37:42] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> quite relative
[12-08-2005 07:37:47] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> angels don
[12-08-2005 07:37:57] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> angels don't dance.. DUUH
[12-08-2005 07:38:05] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> yes they do
[12-08-2005 07:38:16] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> they never danced on my grave...

[12-08-2005 07:40:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> how many angels could fit on a pinhead; if angels possess physical bodies, the answer is "at most a finite number", if they do not, then we rule out any finite number greater than zero as the answer.
