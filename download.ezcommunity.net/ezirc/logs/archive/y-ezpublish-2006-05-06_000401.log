[05-04-2006 05:04:54] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Hello
[05-04-2006 05:05:04] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> hey
[05-04-2006 05:05:10] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Where can I setup which object types a user can attach?
[05-04-2006 05:05:19] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I now have a list of 4, but I need to add one
[05-04-2006 05:05:32] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> A user can have a partner, an image etc
[05-04-2006 05:05:48] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I can't find the relations editor for the user group in question
[05-04-2006 05:05:49] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I guess you're looking  for class defenition
[05-04-2006 05:06:02] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> ok
[05-04-2006 05:06:02] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> under setup --> classes
[05-04-2006 05:07:31] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I know
[05-04-2006 05:07:40] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But I can't find where I can setup the relations
[05-04-2006 05:08:05] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> For example, under a user, I can add a XYZ object to it, from a meny of lets say 4 different types
[05-04-2006 05:08:09] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I dunno where to set it up
[05-04-2006 05:09:06] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> you mean you want to add an image under a user or user-group?
[05-04-2006 05:09:16] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> user, or a "special deal"
[05-04-2006 05:09:20] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Which is a special class
[05-04-2006 05:09:37] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> A user can have a special_deal
[05-04-2006 05:09:50] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But I dunno where to set it up...
[05-04-2006 05:10:01] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I looked under roles etc :-) A bit confusing
[05-04-2006 05:10:15] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> a wild guess.. but i think you'll have to add a new class under User class group..
[05-04-2006 05:10:29] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> add a new class? No, I can't do that
[05-04-2006 05:10:33] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I need to edit the class then
[05-04-2006 05:10:39] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But then I don't get the object relation restrictions
[05-04-2006 05:10:55] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> yeah.. if you need more attributes in the user-class
[05-04-2006 05:11:23] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> lemme be more clear, 1 sec
[05-04-2006 05:13:34] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> ... slow system =)
[05-04-2006 05:13:45] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> Ah.. you're using Related objects attribute in the user-class and you want to restrict what kind of objects you can relate?
[05-04-2006 05:14:42] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I have no idea why eZ loads all the 100's of users for each page view
[05-04-2006 05:14:42] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> yes! =)
[05-04-2006 05:14:42] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> There is already a restriction
[05-04-2006 05:14:42] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> from the prev webmaster
[05-04-2006 05:14:43] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But I can't find where to edit it
[05-04-2006 05:15:08] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> is this a webshop with discounts?
[05-04-2006 05:16:47] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Subitems: Create here: Customer, Deal, User, UserGroup
[05-04-2006 05:16:47] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I want to add another type of Deal under that "Create here" menu
[05-04-2006 05:16:47] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But I can't find it
[05-04-2006 05:16:47] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_6/reference/datatypes/object_relations
[05-04-2006 05:16:48] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I found that
[05-04-2006 05:16:50] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But not how to get to that interface
[05-04-2006 05:17:07] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I guess he could have set restriction to what kind of objects to relate in the ini-files.. I know this is possible
[05-04-2006 05:17:25] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But I can't find it in the ini files :-/
[05-04-2006 05:18:11] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> but if you wanna add/edit [Object relations]-attributes to the user-class that's in setup --> classes --> user
[05-04-2006 05:19:34] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Where?
[05-04-2006 05:19:44] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I'm on setup->classes->users->user
[05-04-2006 05:19:55] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> the edit-button?
[05-04-2006 05:20:49] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Says nothing about anything here, only first_name, last_name, image etc
[05-04-2006 05:20:56] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Not subitem definitions
[05-04-2006 05:21:45] [#ezpublish] <awormus> what are the legal issues with deploying an eZpublish site with modifications (modules, theme) on an external site...
[05-04-2006 05:21:49] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> ok.. then he's probably used an ini-file to restrict the default object relation
[05-04-2006 05:22:00] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> or maybe hacked the kernel ;)
[05-04-2006 05:22:15] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> awormus: gpl license
[05-04-2006 05:23:03] [#ezpublish] <awormus> Tidemann: different people have different interpretations of what it means to modify, or include external material in the package
[05-04-2006 05:23:14] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> http://ez.no/products/licenses/licenses
[05-04-2006 05:24:45] [#ezpublish] <awormus> yeh, that's not exactly what I wanted to hear :)
[05-04-2006 05:24:53] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> *grin*
[05-04-2006 05:24:54] [#ezpublish] <awormus> if you make a template for eZ publish it will be a derivative work
[05-04-2006 05:26:31] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> It is when you distribute eZ publish or derivative work of eZ publish you will have to make a choice of licensing. If you distribute it under GPL (free open source) you do not need to pay for a license. If you distribute eZ publish or derivatives thereof in a non-GPL way, you will need a professional license. You will also need an eZ publish Professional License if you do not want to share your work or if you want to license and sell
[05-04-2006 05:26:55] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> i think that says it all..
[05-04-2006 05:27:07] [#ezpublish] <awormus> not really
[05-04-2006 05:27:30] [#ezpublish] <awormus> well, yes :)
[05-04-2006 05:28:15] [#ezpublish] <awormus> so if I have a client that wants me to deploy a eZpublish site on their server then I will need to pay for a license
[05-04-2006 05:29:01] [#ezpublish] <awormus> but if they are buying hosting from me and I'm deploying on my own server then I don't
[05-04-2006 05:29:47] [#ezpublish] <awormus> you know if ezpublish 4 will have the same license system?
[05-04-2006 05:30:05] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> afaik it will...

[05-04-2006 05:32:12] [#ezpublish] <awormus> OK, what about this question.
[05-04-2006 05:32:41] [#ezpublish] <awormus> If I'm a freelancer, I could be counted as a part of the organisation, so therefore would not be distributing anything to deploy on their server
[05-04-2006 05:35:36] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> UserClassGroupID
[05-04-2006 05:35:39] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> well .. depends on what you deploy I guess... I'm no GPL mastah in any way.. but I guess you could just call them and ask ;) looks like the rest of the guys here are away anyway
[05-04-2006 05:35:41] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> This is what I need to do something with
[05-04-2006 05:36:58] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> UserClassGroupID=2 - what does it mean! _awww_ ;'-(((
[05-04-2006 05:36:59] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> hehe
[05-04-2006 05:37:37] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> eZ publish, is that "evilZz" publish or "easypublish"
[05-04-2006 05:38:20] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> easy publish .. hard development ;)
[05-04-2006 05:38:35] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> # Which class group that has user classes, controls which classes
[05-04-2006 05:38:35] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> # is shown on the user navigation part. If empty all classes are used.

[05-04-2006 05:40:35] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Is it a group class I haven't seen
[05-04-2006 05:41:11] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> i think it's what class group the class user is located
[05-04-2006 05:41:47] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But that brings me to the start where I didn't find anything, it's the User Group class -> Customer

[05-04-2006 05:44:05] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> But I can only make a new class
[05-04-2006 05:44:10] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I can't use one already existing
