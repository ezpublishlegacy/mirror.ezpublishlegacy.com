[02-02-2006 09:49:42] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hmmm I currently have something really strange with ezp
[02-02-2006 09:49:59] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> inside a class, I have a enhanced object relation datatype
[02-02-2006 09:50:14] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I choose some other objects while creating the "main" one
[02-02-2006 09:50:48] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> when I view my object in the admin part, each node ID of those related objects are fine
[02-02-2006 09:51:45] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> now, I move to my template, get back the list of those related objects
[02-02-2006 09:52:31] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> with a $mynode.object.data_map.<my_ero_field>.content
[02-02-2006 09:53:00] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> and there, the list does not contains the node id, but the contentobjectid
[02-02-2006 09:53:24] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> and for one of them, the contentobjectid is not the same as the node id
[02-02-2006 09:53:33] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so my list is... hmmm... f**cked up
[02-02-2006 09:53:44] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> am I doing something wrong ? doctor, what's the matter ?
[02-02-2006 10:00:31] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so now, with my list, I need to do a fetch / object / id, for each of those ids, to know the main node id of those contentobjectid

[02-02-2006 10:44:33] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> i suppose that you  mean "install gd" ?
[02-02-2006 10:44:40] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> imagegd2 being a php function
