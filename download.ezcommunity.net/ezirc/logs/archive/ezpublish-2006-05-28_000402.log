[05-27-2006 01:44:34] [#ezpublish] <xigle1> weired ... /content/view/full/265 shows my correct node, but /content/edit/265 edits another node, actually an image. Looks pretty random. How could this happend?

[05-27-2006 01:58:18] [#ezpublish] <xigleth> Ah, I have to use object-id, not node-id

[05-27-2006 09:38:55] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> there is no limit how many overrides override.ini.append.php can hold?
[05-27-2006 10:26:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> should not
[05-27-2006 10:26:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> it could get slow at some point ;)

[05-27-2006 12:46:57] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> how can i fetch only object with a checkbox-attribute enabled?
[05-27-2006 13:07:06] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I tried fetch(content,list,hash(parent_node_id,$node.node_id,attribute_filter,array(array(224,=,1))))} --> 224 is the attribute (checkbox) id.
[05-27-2006 17:33:50] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> just missed some spaces and quotes
