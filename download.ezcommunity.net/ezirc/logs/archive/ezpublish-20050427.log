[04-27-2005 01:32:57] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> how can I get around the menu breaking when viewing http://mysite.com/users/ ?
[04-27-2005 01:33:53] -!- mode/#ezpublish [+o fh] by ChanServ
[04-27-2005 01:33:56] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> clear
[04-27-2005 01:34:14] [#ezpublish] <@fh> Bedlore: breaking? what do you mean?
[04-27-2005 01:35:11] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> menu works fine, but when on public side if you go to view a user, ie something not in the main content tree then the menu freaks out displays no info
[04-27-2005 01:35:38] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> this use to also happen when shown search results some time back but ez fixed this
[04-27-2005 01:36:18] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> because you are not technically in any specific area of the content tree I guess so $module_result is no longer accurate or something
[04-27-2005 01:39:17] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> fh: check your private msg window to see what I mean
[04-27-2005 01:51:34] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> how can i get current layout in template?
[04-27-2005 01:52:19] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> or give me any clue on overriding print view template for content/view
[04-27-2005 02:08:00] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> found, works: $DesignKeys:used.layout
[04-27-2005 02:14:28] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> if someone know how to set up an override template for print vew, please tell me
[04-27-2005 02:15:17] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I would assume its the same way as normal danmiru
