[05-01-2005 15:55:22] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> rather to give me a tip with this template-snipet
[05-01-2005 15:55:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> http://nopaste.php-q.net/131099
[05-01-2005 15:55:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> LALA:{$folder_node_id_array|attribute(show)} <- here the variable is displayed properly
[05-01-2005 15:56:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> JETZT:{$folder_node_id_array|attribute(show,3)} <- no variable is outputed.
[05-01-2005 16:14:19] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i don't know
[05-01-2005 16:14:28] [#ezpublish] <xbit> :(
[05-01-2005 16:15:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> how could i write a variable and use it somewhere in the template?
[05-01-2005 16:17:01] [#ezpublish] <xbit> you mean {let foo="bar"} ?
[05-01-2005 16:17:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> imagine, according to the link, that i have an array of nodeObjects. now i have to generate an array of node_ids for further processings. how would you manage this?
[05-01-2005 16:17:19] [#ezpublish] <xbit> ah
[05-01-2005 16:18:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> $node.object.related_contentobject_array is the array of nodeObjects and $folder_node_id_array is the array to be generated.
[05-01-2005 16:18:21] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i see
[05-01-2005 16:19:02] [#ezpublish] <xbit> how to do that yes...
[05-01-2005 16:19:14] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i think i've probably done something similiar
[05-01-2005 16:27:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i dont get the trick how to realize this.
