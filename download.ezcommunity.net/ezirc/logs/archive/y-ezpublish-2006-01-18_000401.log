[01-16-2006 08:02:49] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> this error contains: Error: eZTemplate:Attribute node-object-cached of variable $resourceData was not found but variable node EZ_TEMPLATE_TYPE_OPTIMIZED_NODE is still present. This should not happen

[01-16-2006 08:07:58] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hmm that's really strange
[01-16-2006 08:08:06] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so you disabled the TemplateCompile as well ?
[01-16-2006 08:08:40] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> exactly
[01-16-2006 08:37:45] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> another question then :)
[01-16-2006 08:38:10] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> i've got a class definition containing an "object relations"
[01-16-2006 08:38:31] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> hey B-KiLLer` :)
[01-16-2006 08:38:42] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> this "object relations" only allows me to associate existing objects, but I'd like to allow the creation of new items when associating
[01-16-2006 08:38:48] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> how could I proceed ?
[01-16-2006 08:38:50] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hi DiGiTa|_ :p

[01-16-2006 08:41:57] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I don't really want to change the class definition, as this is working quite ok now, I'm afraid to mess things up :-/
[01-16-2006 08:42:15] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> and a lot of content is already inserted in the site
[01-16-2006 08:42:17] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> hey then, there are no issue
[01-16-2006 08:42:32] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so, object relations does not allow to create items upon association ?

[01-16-2006 08:45:30] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> there is a select box "type", where you can "choose": only existing objects

[01-16-2006 08:53:42] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> in fact, to let you know about my situation:
[01-16-2006 08:54:12] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I have a class which describes a menu.  Currently, the menu items are entered using object relations
[01-16-2006 08:54:31] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> wouldn't it be better to use directly the fact that a class can be a container
[01-16-2006 08:54:42] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> an then use the sub items functionnality ?
[01-16-2006 09:06:50] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> 90% is betterr, B-KiLLer`, yes
[01-16-2006 09:08:34] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes of course
[01-16-2006 09:08:38] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i use this system
[01-16-2006 09:08:39] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :))
[01-16-2006 09:11:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hey. my boss wants to have a date into the name of eZ content objects, but the way eZ renders the date makes the mane too long (Sun, 10 Jun, blah blah) ... is there an ini setting to make so that eZ will use a shortdate format ?
[01-16-2006 09:12:25] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> Sulfur: define myowndateformat in date.ini then use datetime('myowndateformat')
[01-16-2006 09:12:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> Sulfur: btw, that should not work in the name of the object ...
[01-16-2006 09:13:14] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes, I need it in the name of the object :))
[01-16-2006 09:13:58] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> one problem came to my mind though ... using the class as a container does not allow you to place an existing object as sub item of that class, does it ?
[01-16-2006 09:13:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i didn't succeed to change this date format. I needed that for sorting, finaly i used another solution =]
[01-16-2006 09:14:04] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I wonder why 80% of the questions my PM makes me need some tweaking or coding into eZ ... can't he just go with the flow??? :))
[01-16-2006 09:14:19] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> oh yes seasonfive ? how did you do that ?

[01-16-2006 09:15:14] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> Sulfur: sort_by, array('attribute', 'false', 'event/date') or sthg like that
[01-16-2006 09:15:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> zrg: either our bosses are pointy-ahired dilbertian characters, or eZ is a huge monolithic cathedral of code which caters to the 20% of CMS funciotnalities that no one ever uses??? :))

[01-16-2006 13:38:49] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> are you kidding?
[01-16-2006 13:38:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> no
[01-16-2006 13:38:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> divide by 15 for euros
[01-16-2006 13:39:05] [#ezpublish] <zrg> there must be simpler way sulphur..
[01-16-2006 13:39:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> take that link
[01-16-2006 13:39:15] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> it IS simple ...
[01-16-2006 13:39:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> look at the link
[01-16-2006 13:39:46] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> you can omit the last brackets as it is the file size
[01-16-2006 13:40:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> lol, i've been here ;)
[01-16-2006 13:40:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.file icon_size='small' icon_title=$node.name} ?
[01-16-2006 13:40:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> anyone ever been to the dominican rep.?
[01-16-2006 13:40:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, no, it puts other garbage in
[01-16-2006 13:46:03] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> What's $allegato?
[01-16-2006 13:46:20] [#ezpublish] <zrg> replace with $node
[01-16-2006 13:46:31] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes sorry

[01-16-2006 13:47:14] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ah, and file must be the attribute identifier of your file attribute, of curse.
[01-16-2006 13:47:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> cOurse
[01-16-2006 13:48:21] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> Yeah, got that.
[01-16-2006 13:48:49] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> ANd now for the other challenge. My folder class has a field called "description". I want to display this in a template? How?
[01-16-2006 13:49:14] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> this is laughable when compared to the first one :p
[01-16-2006 13:49:20] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> I've been trying with $node.data_map.description and so forth.
[01-16-2006 13:49:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you might want to look how your default templates do it
[01-16-2006 13:49:44] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> {attribute_view_gui attribute=ct.data_map.yourattridentifier}
[01-16-2006 13:50:00] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> I tried that, but it didn't work.
[01-16-2006 13:52:04] [#ezpublish] <zrg> please look at your existing templates, like in ./design/base/override/templates/full/folder.tpl
[01-16-2006 13:52:46] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> I've looked at that, and copied it.
[01-16-2006 13:52:48] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> But it does not work.
[01-16-2006 13:52:53] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data:map.yourattridentifier}
[01-16-2006 13:53:07] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> data:map?
[01-16-2006 13:53:12] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> I thought it was data_map?
[01-16-2006 13:53:15] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> data_map sorry.
[01-16-2006 13:53:21] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> But that's what I'm using.
[01-16-2006 13:53:29] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.description}
[01-16-2006 13:53:29] [#ezpublish] <zrg> then you have done something wrong, go over it again
[01-16-2006 13:53:44] [#ezpublish] <zrg> and first and foremost, clear the caches
[01-16-2006 13:54:46] [#ezpublish] <Foolish> clearing the cache fixed it, thanks guys.
[01-16-2006 13:55:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ALWAYS ALWAYS clear the cache after ANY changes
[01-16-2006 13:56:26] [#ezpublish] <zrg> print it with half meter letters on the wall
[01-16-2006 13:56:36] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ez.no should sell posters like that..
[01-16-2006 13:56:38] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I'd also say: when developing, forget about cache
[01-16-2006 13:56:49] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> "clear the cache, luke"
[01-16-2006 13:57:35] [#ezpublish] <zrg> its easiest for newbie to remember to clear it manually every time than to muck around in conf to disable it
[01-16-2006 13:58:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> bah. copying a default .ini.append file is just a matter of seconds :)
[01-16-2006 13:58:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> but, a big switch right next to "clear cache" in admin "All caching off", would be a Good Thing
[01-16-2006 13:58:39] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> especially when developing, I could not bear to clear it every time I change something
[01-16-2006 13:59:08] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you have to know how, you wont at first, trust me i remember
[01-16-2006 13:59:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> uh ... maybe it's because I went through the ez training course :p
[01-16-2006 14:00:10] [#ezpublish] <zrg> probably
[01-16-2006 14:00:27] [#ezpublish] <zrg> its good, but you have to understand everyone cant
[01-16-2006 14:00:44] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes yes ... but isn't the cache disabled by default ?
[01-16-2006 14:00:48] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no
[01-16-2006 14:00:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> uh, ok.
