[11-15-2005 11:24:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i was talking yesterday )or so( about my modfied set of ezpublish build from svn scripts
[11-15-2005 11:26:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and i was working (again, finaly) on cleaning up 1.7 TB of data across 15+ disks and reorganizing the content for my own sanity :D (ha!)
[11-15-2005 11:26:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and i stumbeled upon them and a bunch of other clean backups i thought i had lost

[11-15-2005 11:28:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker>  i need to find out exactly if seawolfx was really trying to build from svn or what but with a user and a more clear idea of what is needed, i'll go ahead and pickup this subproject again
[11-15-2005 11:29:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i need to test the whole scripts again and do (i wager) a bit more abstraction, cleanup, review of some of the spur of the moment code changes i made and refine them to work for other users in a more *sane* way
[11-15-2005 11:29:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> with any luck i'll be able to return a clean set of patches to eZ systems and the community to allow us all to (at least for development) build from svn

[11-15-2005 14:01:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> is it a really gateway?
[11-15-2005 14:01:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and there's NO info about that

[11-15-2005 14:01:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we could share it, i guess, but since it's for a payment provider in luxembourg...

[11-15-2005 14:02:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> on the other hand since i leave in 6 weeks... :)
[11-15-2005 14:02:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> is there a documentation which leads through the makedist.sh distri-building process?
[11-15-2005 14:02:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> well if it makes any difference i don't really want your code (per say) since i'm in the usa, but i am working on a payment workflow / gateway project for authorize.net (major usa provider of verification info)
[11-15-2005 14:02:59] -!- nnn0 is now known as [o_0]
[11-15-2005 14:03:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> SEAwolfx, not a chance
[11-15-2005 14:03:08] -!- [o_0] is now known as nnn0
[11-15-2005 14:03:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> urghs.
[11-15-2005 14:03:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Katana`, ok here is my email address (if you please)
[11-15-2005 14:03:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i can probably do something for your kracker
[11-15-2005 14:04:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Katana`, you get my personal message + email
[11-15-2005 14:04:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> email i got
[11-15-2005 14:04:44] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> comments are in french though ...
[11-15-2005 14:05:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i would be most apreciated of any and all information / code you might be able to drop me in the mail, and will credit you when I release eZ authorize(.net)
[11-15-2005 14:05:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> still working on the name, should i cut the .net out of authorize.net or not, pondering :\
[11-15-2005 14:06:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i was leaning towards droping .net but thinking more and more that it would reduce confusion if i did not drop .net (uncertain on trademark on that call though)
[11-15-2005 14:06:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, the issue is that my main job in that extension was just "consulting"
[11-15-2005 14:06:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> e.g. hacking around the code to get my coworker to do the job
[11-15-2005 14:07:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh
[11-15-2005 14:07:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and it was back 3 month agop
[11-15-2005 14:07:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> -p
[11-15-2005 14:07:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't mind if comments were in french, the code alone will answere the breakdowns we were getting into :\
[11-15-2005 14:08:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> SEAwolfx, not to forget that the makedist.sh script is very very (horribly) complex and poorly abstracted, lots of room for bash functions and imporovement (i am not chastizing ez, just stating the obvios from a no nothing view point like mine :D)
[11-15-2005 14:09:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> atm, i fail in this step: "Checking db update version numbersPassword for 'root':"
[11-15-2005 14:09:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> damn.
[11-15-2005 14:10:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> sent, kracker
[11-15-2005 14:11:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but gateways really, really require doc...
[11-15-2005 14:11:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Katana`, wow, a big thank you, here's hoping (dido - thank you) ...
[11-15-2005 14:11:47] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Katana`, ?
[11-15-2005 14:11:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yes ?
[11-15-2005 14:13:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh, never mind, i understand now
[11-15-2005 14:14:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and i, concure
[11-15-2005 14:16:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think want killed me up till now was trying to do a real payment gateway (not workflow) but be able to have a cc card info form from eZ publish (no redirecting the user to the payment provider) and using backend code to authorize without redirecting the user to the provider to input the cc info, rather using ezpublish inside the existing hook system back to itself for the form and then back into the checkout process upon success
[11-15-2005 14:16:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> or returning to the form for error handeling
[11-15-2005 14:16:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> as far as i know the payment gateway you can buy from ez implements both
[11-15-2005 14:16:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and the PG system allows both
[11-15-2005 14:16:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> e.g. direct and the other one
[11-15-2005 14:16:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> course it does :)
[11-15-2005 14:17:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but no docs for us (hits myself in the face)

[11-15-2005 19:22:42] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> seems
[11-15-2005 19:22:47] [#ezpublish] <zr1> okay, if you look at that line you see it tries to include file
[11-15-2005 19:22:51] [#ezpublish] <climber> On ezpublish-old-versions, I just put http://localhost/ezpublish and have the web wizard fine
[11-15-2005 19:23:02] [#ezpublish] <climber> yes

[11-15-2005 19:32:07] [#ezpublish] <climber> GOAL
[11-15-2005 19:32:21] [#ezpublish] <climber> I change one-per-one
[11-15-2005 19:32:55] [#ezpublish] <zr1> muh?
[11-15-2005 19:33:11] [#ezpublish] <zr1> just change one, if error moves its the include path
[11-15-2005 19:33:46] [#ezpublish] <zr1> include paths should be relative to calling scripts directory
[11-15-2005 19:34:39] [#ezpublish] <climber> the include_path from php.ini?
[11-15-2005 19:35:24] [#ezpublish] <zr1> http://ee.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php
[11-15-2005 19:35:39] [#ezpublish] <zr1> tried full path?
[11-15-2005 19:36:56] [#ezpublish] <climber> yes
[11-15-2005 19:37:18] [#ezpublish] <climber> but I have more and more errors
[11-15-2005 19:37:27] [#ezpublish] <zr1> yes helps me little, did error move?
[11-15-2005 19:37:59] [#ezpublish] <climber> I need config the correct path in one file
[11-15-2005 19:38:08] [#ezpublish] <climber> yes
[11-15-2005 19:40:06] [#ezpublish] <zr1> what include_path= you have in php.ini ?

[11-15-2005 19:40:41] [#ezpublish] <zr1> whole line

[11-15-2005 19:41:39] [#ezpublish] <zr1> have you changed it from original?
[11-15-2005 19:41:44] [#ezpublish] <climber> no

[11-15-2005 19:42:33] [#ezpublish] <zr1> you dont have current directory in include path, of course includes wont work :)
[11-15-2005 19:43:01] [#ezpublish] <climber> GREATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
[11-15-2005 19:43:18] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :D
[11-15-2005 19:43:59] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> is that a bug then ?
[11-15-2005 19:44:01] [#ezpublish] <zr1> kill the one who changed it, send me a pizza :)
[11-15-2005 19:44:11] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[11-15-2005 19:44:40] [#ezpublish] <zr1> try to find out what changed it, i suppose vanilla php.ini has the . in
[11-15-2005 19:45:27] [#ezpublish] <zr1> BUT, this could be detected in install, if you go to community page and file a suggestion there you will help others, a nice thing to do
[11-15-2005 19:46:20] [#ezpublish] <climber> yes
[11-15-2005 19:46:27] [#ezpublish] <climber> There´s a bug
[11-15-2005 19:46:39] [#ezpublish] <climber> I don´t change the php.ini
[11-15-2005 19:47:45] [#ezpublish] <zr1> probably bug in some suse package then
[11-15-2005 19:48:31] [#ezpublish] <zr1> how to find out: do "ls /usr/share/php", tell me few first lines
[11-15-2005 19:49:35] [#ezpublish] <climber> I have the error in the web wizard to
[11-15-2005 19:50:03] [#ezpublish] <climber> error for inclusion ('usr/share/php')
[11-15-2005 19:50:12] [#ezpublish] <zr1> what error?
[11-15-2005 19:50:15] [#ezpublish] <climber> I try to find this error
[11-15-2005 19:53:33] [#ezpublish] <zr1> what error do you have in web wizard??
[11-15-2005 19:53:45] [#ezpublish] <climber> error with includes
[11-15-2005 19:54:07] [#ezpublish] <climber> and ('usr/share/php')
[11-15-2005 19:54:24] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> think he means the error itself ;)
[11-15-2005 19:54:48] [#ezpublish] <zr1> of course i mean error itself, not a imterpretation in verse :)
[11-15-2005 19:54:56] [#ezpublish] <climber> I try to find the complete error with the "inclusion ('/usr/share/php') error
