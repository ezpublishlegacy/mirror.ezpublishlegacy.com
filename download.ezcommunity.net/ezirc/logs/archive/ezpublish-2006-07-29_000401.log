[07-28-2006 10:35:14] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> how's it going tobmaster?
[07-28-2006 10:35:35] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> good and you?
[07-28-2006 10:36:21] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> good, thanks!  I found a bug in 3.8.2 (which I'm using) and I tried applying the patch that was listed with the bug, and that didn't work...  what would be the best way to move my "kernel" to another version (3.8.1 or a dev version of 3.8.2) without messing too much with my db or site configuration?
[07-28-2006 10:36:50] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> which bug was it ?
[07-28-2006 10:37:07] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> the html not displaying properly...  one sec, I'll find the exact bug number...
[07-28-2006 10:37:24] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> http://ez.no/bugs/view/8702
[07-28-2006 10:37:39] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> ah yes I got that one too :)
[07-28-2006 10:37:50] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> have you worked around it?
[07-28-2006 10:37:53] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> though, I didn't used the "patch" mentioned below
[07-28-2006 10:38:04] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> I tried applying the patch at the bottom, and it didn't work for me...
[07-28-2006 10:38:05] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> i got back a directory from the latest svn
[07-28-2006 10:38:25] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> this directory in fact: kernel/classes/datatypes/ezxmltext/
[07-28-2006 10:38:37] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> i replaced the 3.8.2 one with the one from svn, and everything went fine
[07-28-2006 10:38:51] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> and if I just update that one directory out of svn that should work ok?  No chance there'll be dependencies on other update code or anything?
[07-28-2006 10:39:21] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> i had no further problems, on my side
[07-28-2006 10:39:34] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> could I take it out of the newly released 3.8.3 or would that be playing with fire?
[07-28-2006 10:39:35] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> maybe you could just get the file where the "patch" given in the bug report was applied
[07-28-2006 10:39:54] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> already released the 3.8.3 ?
[07-28-2006 10:40:07] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> http://ez.no/download/ez_publish
[07-28-2006 10:40:20] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> July 26th it was released...
[07-28-2006 10:40:22] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> apparently
[07-28-2006 10:40:23] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I wouldn't do it... :)
[07-28-2006 10:40:32] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> :-) ok, fair enough
[07-28-2006 10:40:53] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> i urged on installing the 3.8 when it was released but I whish I hadn't :)
[07-28-2006 10:41:13] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> B-KiLLer`: first test - then install :)
[07-28-2006 10:41:20] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> <grin>
[07-28-2006 10:41:24] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> B-KiLLer`: have you installed it on productive?
[07-28-2006 10:41:33] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> nope
[07-28-2006 10:41:40] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> still on test, but for a new site we had to develop
[07-28-2006 10:41:43] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> 3.8.3 came out so soon after 3.8.2, were there a lot of other problems with 3.8.2?
[07-28-2006 10:41:54] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hopefully they releasead 3.8.1 quite quickly to correct a lot of bugs
[07-28-2006 10:42:13] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> and hopefully they released 3.8.2 quite quickly to correct really annoying bugs
[07-28-2006 10:42:18] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> I'm working on my first ez publish site, the production is 3.8.1, and I'm developing/testing with 3.8.2...
[07-28-2006 10:42:22] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> (like for images which were deleted from content, but still displaying)
[07-28-2006 10:42:37] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> DodgerM1976: you are the one from canada right?
[07-28-2006 10:42:41] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> 3.8.2 with the patch for ezxml seems to do the job right now ...
[07-28-2006 10:42:43] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> hmmm, I wonder if I should encourage the client to claw it back to 3.7
[07-28-2006 10:42:44] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> DodgerM1976: did you get good help?
[07-28-2006 10:42:49] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> tobmaster: that's me :-)
[07-28-2006 10:43:05] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> DodgerM1976: why do you want to change to 3.7?
[07-28-2006 10:43:16] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> there are no downgrade scripts
[07-28-2006 10:44:14] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> tobmaster: not really...  I contact the ez office in vancouver and they haven't gotten back to me yet, and I contacted a web dev firm here in toronto that supposedly specializes in ez publish, and they haven't gotten back to me yet either...
[07-28-2006 10:44:29] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> I feel a little bit more on track with the work though, making progress (albeit slowly) on my own
[07-28-2006 10:44:52] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> tobmaster: I'd just want to downgrade if the 3.8 series is flacky...
[07-28-2006 10:45:23] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> its a fresh install, so I wouldn't really need to downgrade, just remove what's there and start again with 3.7 (using the templates and what I've learned in 3.8)
[07-28-2006 10:45:39] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> I'll probably stick with 3.8 though, I'm sure 3.7 has its own issue...
[07-28-2006 10:45:42] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> er issues
[07-28-2006 10:45:47] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> of course
[07-28-2006 10:45:56] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> but as I say, 3.8.2 seems good now
[07-28-2006 10:46:12] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> got a question too :)
[07-28-2006 10:46:31] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I have an url like /agencies/ on my site
[07-28-2006 10:46:37] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> if I wanted to switch over to the new 3.8.3, how would I go about it?  the upgrade scripts seem to assume you're coming from 3.7...  can I just drop in the 3.8.3 code somehow?
[07-28-2006 10:46:46] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> this url is pointing to a node in the content structure, of course
[07-28-2006 10:46:52] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> (not a module, or whatever)
[07-28-2006 10:47:20] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> ok
[07-28-2006 10:47:23] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> now, i'd like the template of that page to be able to post information to the same url, and do a search based on those info
[07-28-2006 10:47:28] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> those posted info
[07-28-2006 10:47:39] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> what's the best way to proceed ?
[07-28-2006 10:47:41] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> sorry, way beyond me :-(
[07-28-2006 10:47:59] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> tobmaster, if you could help me on this :)
[07-28-2006 10:48:28] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> i could maybe create a module, but then I can't keep my /agencies/ url, right ? the module has to have its own url ?
[07-28-2006 10:49:02] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> the other issue I had yesterday was I "switched" the root node in my content structure with one of its children.  After doing this, nothing is showing up in the content manager panel on the upper left had side - I've cleared the cache and rebooted the computer...  is there any way I can get the content structure display back in the admin?
[07-28-2006 10:51:15] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> I have a bunch of sections, each with different content (links, jokes, etc, etc, etc).  Is it reasonable to have a "folder" for each of the sections that would then hold the specific content, or would I be better to create a custom container for each?

[07-28-2006 14:00:36] [privmsg] <lilo> Hi....just a reminder. As of 11am GMT on Sunday, freenode will allow Tor access only via the hidden service. Please take a look at http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml and switch as soon as possible. It's easier than it sounds. Sorry for any repetition of this message. Thanks!
