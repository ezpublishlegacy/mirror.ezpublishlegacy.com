[03-15-2006 04:38:56] [#ezpublish] <phretor> hello there
[03-15-2006 04:41:44] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I'm having issues with the design of a feedback form. I need to customise the default class providing the additional field 'Departement'; it should be of Option type (dropdown menu) listing all departements (dynamically added!). How would you handle this?

[03-15-2006 04:42:45] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> hi
[03-15-2006 04:43:02] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hello
[03-15-2006 04:43:19] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> forget my question about class and group of class
[03-15-2006 04:43:21] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ;)
[03-15-2006 04:43:46] [#ezpublish] <phretor> if my problem is not well explained, please tell me; I'll rephrase it :-)
[03-15-2006 04:44:33] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> phretor: have you tried adding an attribute of type ezselection ?
[03-15-2006 04:44:47] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> that should be enough
[03-15-2006 04:45:06] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: this is not the main issue; the real problem is that the option list is not fixed
[03-15-2006 04:45:23] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> not fixed?
[03-15-2006 04:45:35] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> where does that list come from?
[03-15-2006 04:45:48] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: it can grow as new departments are added
[03-15-2006 04:46:01] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> you can also add new values to the selection
[03-15-2006 04:46:06] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> when you alter the class
[03-15-2006 04:46:33] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: the customer must be unaware about those changes
[03-15-2006 04:47:06] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: when a new instance of "Departement" is added by the customer, it must appear in the selection list
[03-15-2006 04:47:24] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> elsewise make a ordinary simple text attribute and a override template for the that attribute
[03-15-2006 04:47:41] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> -the
[03-15-2006 04:47:57] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: the admin template?
[03-15-2006 04:47:57] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> then you can fetch from whereever you want
[03-15-2006 04:48:10] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> admin?
[03-15-2006 04:48:17] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> i guess it was a feedback form
[03-15-2006 04:48:29] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> i guess you have that on some kinda frontpage?
[03-15-2006 04:48:53] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: yes, sorry, but this is a common problem so I generalised my question :-)
[03-15-2006 04:49:08] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> or use a single object relation
[03-15-2006 04:49:16] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> there you can define a location
[03-15-2006 04:49:23] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> where to fetch objects from
[03-15-2006 04:49:47] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> and define also that it is selected via dropdown
[03-15-2006 04:49:50] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: I'm now using Object Relations (since one, say Project, could belong to more than one Department)
[03-15-2006 04:51:02] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> ?
[03-15-2006 04:52:26] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: e.g., more than one Department could be involved to the same Project. For that reason, Project has more than one object relation (!= single object relation)
[03-15-2006 04:53:40] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: did you get the idea?

[03-15-2006 05:18:00] [#ezpublish] <phretor> generally speaking, my problem is: "how do I affect the editing of a list of object relations in order to reduce it to a multiple-choice selection instead of the default way?"
[03-15-2006 05:20:55] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> then you maybe should use object rel. list and make a custom template to let the user select
[03-15-2006 05:25:10] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: ezobjectrelationlist.tpl?
[03-15-2006 05:32:42] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: I just overridden ezobjectrelationlist.tpl for the 'admin' siteaccess but I cannot feel any kind of modification; it remained the same, at all.
[03-15-2006 05:37:52] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> check the list of used templates
[03-15-2006 05:38:06] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> i havent it in my brain ready which template it is :)

[03-15-2006 06:30:37] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: ok, I found that is ezobjectrelationlist.tpl
[03-15-2006 06:49:14] [#ezpublish] <phretor> what does $foo:bar means?
[03-15-2006 06:50:42] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> foo:bar?
[03-15-2006 06:51:04] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: I used dummy names, what does ':' means instead of '.'?
[03-15-2006 06:51:17] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: I found $Relation:item statements
[03-15-2006 06:52:46] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: anyway, it's not so easy to customize the way relations are added
[03-15-2006 06:52:53] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> : are namespaces in tpl language
[03-15-2006 06:53:29] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: have you ever tried to customize a relation list in that way?
[03-15-2006 06:55:35] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: if you have suggestions they would be appreciated :-)

[03-15-2006 07:09:43] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: the fetch of possible objects is not a problem, at all. The real problem is: what object data is needed for relations? where to send such data?
[03-15-2006 07:10:41] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> when you customized the fetch only it should work directly?!?! i hope :)
