[04-26-2005 04:12:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> now?
[04-26-2005 04:12:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yes!
[04-26-2005 04:13:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hey Bedlore ...
[04-26-2005 04:13:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you got a second for something cool?
[04-26-2005 04:13:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's such a hack but i'm going to clean it up and do something releasable with it i think (cause it was so much fun)
[04-26-2005 04:14:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> now i have to do it lest my own voice come back to haunt me ;)
[04-26-2005 04:16:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and i think i can twist it around to do some really cool things with some other similar ideas and refreshes
[04-26-2005 04:16:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> now if i could do that with templates ...
[04-26-2005 04:17:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so the human readable (redundant, text) logs start here: http://download.ezpublishhosting.com/ezirc/logs/IQ-current.log
[04-26-2005 04:17:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> with more logs in the dir
[04-26-2005 04:17:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i ended up getting it going with IQ
[04-26-2005 04:17:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so now for the really fun part ...
[04-26-2005 04:18:12] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> gimme a min kracker, just helping SEAwolfx
[04-26-2005 04:18:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ya
[04-26-2005 04:20:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so what do you think, is a log a single updated text field or a container (folder) with datetime asc children (called lines) with priority set to numeric timestamp (again asc) each container could have as many lines/messages as sent to all the clients in the channel.
[04-26-2005 04:32:24] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> kracker: rockin, I've often wondered what goes on in #ezpublish when I'm not here
