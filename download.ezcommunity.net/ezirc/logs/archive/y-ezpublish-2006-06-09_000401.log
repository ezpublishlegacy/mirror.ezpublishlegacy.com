[06-07-2006 01:47:27] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I'm having some cache issues...
[06-07-2006 01:48:00] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> if I try this:

[06-07-2006 08:42:46] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> hi
[06-07-2006 08:43:47] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> why in the admin panel , at the left, i see the content structure, but i onlsy see the nodes with folders, how could i see the real node structure, not only the nodes with folders.
[06-07-2006 08:44:27] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> jeremiah: => contentstructuremenu.ini
[06-07-2006 08:45:25] [#ezpublish] <zrg> should show verything in admin by default
[06-07-2006 08:46:28] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> ah, ok ok, thx
[06-07-2006 08:50:20] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> it works, thx kalooni
[06-07-2006 08:51:08] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> its a pity the panel control is so terribly slow in my localhost, apache with windows
[06-07-2006 08:51:13] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> where i am learning
[06-07-2006 08:52:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> lots of content?
[06-07-2006 08:53:05] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> no
[06-07-2006 08:53:16] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> very little content
[06-07-2006 08:53:53] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> only ten articles, no more
[06-07-2006 08:54:08] [#ezpublish] <zrg> poor pc?
[06-07-2006 08:54:26] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> two processors, 1GB i think is good
[06-07-2006 08:55:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> have cacahing turned off or something?
[06-07-2006 08:55:18] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> HEHEHEHE, probably
[06-07-2006 08:55:19] [#ezpublish] <zrg> windows sucks naturally but should not be that bad
[06-07-2006 08:56:12] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> yes, i have just seen i have the cache disconeccted in the admin panel, i disconected it to learn, but i think that i have to disconect it only in the web, not in the panel, ok?
[06-07-2006 08:57:14] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> si, i will try to modify the settings to conect the cache in the PANEL ADMIN, and let disconnected in the web while i learn
[06-07-2006 08:57:19] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i think is better so
[06-07-2006 08:58:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> thx zrg
[06-07-2006 08:59:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> just leave the caching on and use clear cache whenever you have changed something
[06-07-2006 09:01:33] [#ezpublish] <gluegadget> I've checked-out svn and then exported it to a directory for VirtualHost, although it's my first attempt to run index.php but the installer doesn't start and the login page appears

[06-07-2006 09:05:05] [#ezpublish] <gluegadget> huh ?
[06-07-2006 09:06:16] [#ezpublish] <zrg> just joking, the above sentence did not make any sense to me :)
[06-07-2006 09:07:28] [#ezpublish] <gluegadget> :)

[06-07-2006 09:45:25] [#ezpublish] <zrg> there probably is function like int()
[06-07-2006 09:45:36] [#ezpublish] <phretor> they ARE int
[06-07-2006 10:15:16] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: I need to do a fetch and to filter an attribute that is an array of integers. I other words I need to do the dual of array( array( 'my_array_of_ints', 'in',  '1') ) ) )}
[06-07-2006 10:15:58] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: in other words, the node must be fetched if the attribute named my_array_of_ints does contain a certain integer
