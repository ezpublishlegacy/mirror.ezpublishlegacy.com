[11-21-2005 02:49:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> morning
[11-21-2005 02:50:07] [#ezpublish] * Katana` has started an ezp admin interface based on qooxdoo
[11-21-2005 02:50:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[11-21-2005 03:05:07] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> to make an interface?
[11-21-2005 03:05:10] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> morning btw
[11-21-2005 03:05:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've started writing it
[11-21-2005 03:07:06] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> goodie
[11-21-2005 03:30:10] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[11-21-2005 03:45:59] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> so, if a user can edit content, he can edit all content on all nodes/object in all section he/she has access too. So if I wnat to let the user only edit articles, I need to put all other stuff in a section taht that user don't have edit-access too
[11-21-2005 03:46:09] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> oh, taht was a difficult sentence
[11-21-2005 03:48:24] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> nevermind
[11-21-2005 04:10:30] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> Katana`:  that sounds cool...
[11-21-2005 04:11:08] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> drag and drop workflows.. that would be the shit...
[11-21-2005 04:12:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hehehe :)
[11-21-2005 04:12:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm uploading a version kh[eZ]
[11-21-2005 04:12:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's really proof of concept level but the idea is here :)
[11-21-2005 04:13:29] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> ok.. cool... the ajax menu was just a prototype too :-)
[11-21-2005 04:13:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> http://www.katana-inc.com/files/code/ez_publish_ajax_admin_interface
[11-21-2005 04:13:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> there you are :)
[11-21-2005 04:13:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, everything in the admin has to be implemented so... :)
[11-21-2005 04:13:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it doesn't do much at the moment ;)
[11-21-2005 04:14:16] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> you should just put a demo online :-)
[11-21-2005 04:14:29] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> it would be cool to see...
[11-21-2005 04:14:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i could do that yep
[11-21-2005 04:14:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but it's really easy to setup on any ezp install
[11-21-2005 04:14:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> drop the extension, add an admin siteaccess, add the design & extension
[11-21-2005 04:15:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and add a rewrite rule
[11-21-2005 04:15:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> tadaa
[11-21-2005 04:15:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've just noticed it was even using crystalsvg for the icons, i have to mutualize that as well
[11-21-2005 04:15:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> give it a try ;)

[11-21-2005 06:51:36] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> eZ should get a module which zaps users that tries to do stupid things
[11-21-2005 06:51:49] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> actually, all software should have that
[11-21-2005 06:52:01] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> then they'd learn

[11-21-2005 07:53:37] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> nevermind.. just my brain disfunctioning again...
[11-21-2005 07:55:58] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> I think kh[eZ] has been zapped
[11-21-2005 08:01:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> why was I reading rapped instead of zapped ?
[11-21-2005 08:02:55] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> because you have been zapped

[11-21-2005 08:03:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> must be a truly cold day in hell
[11-21-2005 08:03:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> wtf? 4mb
[11-21-2005 08:04:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> do you have that online someplace? i should write on my paper today, not install pre alpha snapshots
[11-21-2005 08:06:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope buz
[11-21-2005 08:07:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> 4mb are for the icons in the widgets package
[11-21-2005 08:07:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> doesnt live in svn either i presume?
[11-21-2005 08:07:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i have not simplified that yet
[11-21-2005 08:07:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> not yet buz, only locally
[11-21-2005 08:07:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'd leave the icons in
[11-21-2005 08:07:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> who cares for some more space
[11-21-2005 08:07:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> 4mb damnit, don't tell me you're on 56K
[11-21-2005 08:07:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the icons are the same as ez...
[11-21-2005 08:07:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> crystal
[11-21-2005 08:07:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> i like crystal
[11-21-2005 08:07:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i don't see why they should be duplicated :)
[11-21-2005 08:07:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> have them everywhere ;)
[11-21-2005 08:07:59] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> make icons not war
[11-21-2005 08:08:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> so i'll probably use the ones from ez instead
[11-21-2005 08:08:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> i hate that PoS online learing thing
[11-21-2005 08:11:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'll add it to community if people are interested buz
[11-21-2005 08:39:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hum I think nobody's gonna try my interface until I add an online demo ;)
