[04-11-2006 18:06:45] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> anyone here found ez2.2 mail stuff to be insecure? I think we are been used as a mail spam service via the mail to friend thing
[04-11-2006 22:26:07] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> how can I change this php line to search an array?
[04-11-2006 22:26:19] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> if ( !strstr( $HTTP_REFERER, $ini->read_var( "eZFormMain", "FromURL" ) ) )
[04-11-2006 22:26:45] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I need it to be able to match multiple
[04-11-2006 22:52:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm
[04-11-2006 22:52:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> interesting point
[04-11-2006 22:52:55] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> trying to create a spam trap for ez2.2 send mail to a friend
[04-11-2006 22:53:29] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> basic code for one url works well, i.e.
[04-11-2006 22:53:30] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> if ( !strstr( $HTTP_REFERER, $ini->read_var( "eZFormMain", "FromURL" ) ) )
[04-11-2006 22:53:30] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> {
[04-11-2006 22:53:30] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore>     die( "eZ guestbook is not configured correctly. Please check your site.ini file" );
[04-11-2006 22:53:30] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> }
[04-11-2006 22:54:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i used something around the lines like for my blog spam filter / forum ... using apache configs tho
[04-11-2006 22:54:14] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> however if the form failed because they forgot their email address etc, then the url becomes /form/form/process/1//
[04-11-2006 22:54:24] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> so then we need a FromURL2
[04-11-2006 22:54:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ah
[04-11-2006 22:54:45] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> Jo Henrick wrote the code for his old ezguestbook
[04-11-2006 22:54:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i remember
[04-11-2006 22:54:56] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> worked very effectivfely (for one submit url)  :)
[04-11-2006 22:55:20] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I figure it could work for other ez2.2 weak areas as well
[04-11-2006 22:55:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> second or check in the if ?
[04-11-2006 22:55:40] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> but my knowledge of php is as good as my Russian, (non existent)  :P
[04-11-2006 22:55:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> right
[04-11-2006 22:56:13] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I thought this was close;
[04-11-2006 22:56:14] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> if(strstr($HTTP_REFERER, $ini->read_var( "eZFormMain", "FromURL" )) || strstr($HTTP_REFERER, $ini->read_var( "eZFormMain", "FromURL2" )))
[04-11-2006 22:56:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> close
[04-11-2006 22:56:35] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> but it doesn't work
[04-11-2006 22:56:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hey if someone was was to pay me a lot of money to do php dev, how much do you think i could get in us? i have an offer i'm just wondering ..
[04-11-2006 22:56:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> eyah
[04-11-2006 22:57:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, i should be charging for irc support ;)
[04-11-2006 22:57:27] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> sheesh, dunno some programmers are asking US$200 p/h but thats way out of the league for little players like me
[04-11-2006 22:58:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if( strstr($HTTP_REFERER, $ini->read_var( "eZFormMain", "FromURL" ) ) || strstr($HTTP_REFERER, $ini->read_var( "eZFormMain", "FromURL2" ))
[04-11-2006 22:59:24] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> hmm I missed a bracket did I
[04-11-2006 22:59:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> doh
[04-11-2006 22:59:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> no
[04-11-2006 22:59:33] [#ezpublish] <kracker> my bad
[04-11-2006 22:59:37] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> nod
[04-11-2006 23:00:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> wow that's like $384 k yearly sallary
[04-11-2006 23:00:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> my offer was a little less than that
[04-11-2006 23:00:40] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> yeh, I guess for blue chip corporates looking for consulting etc and project work they find it acceptable
[04-11-2006 23:00:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[04-11-2006 23:01:02] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> full timers would never get anywhere near that I doubt
[04-11-2006 23:01:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i dont' see missing brackets, what's the error
[04-11-2006 23:01:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ahh, well how about fulltime sallary then
[04-11-2006 23:01:42] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> well if I set FromURL2=/blah/blah it still works
[04-11-2006 23:01:57] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> where can I post this fix too?
[04-11-2006 23:02:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the forum would be great
[04-11-2006 23:02:14] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> ezp2.2 users really need to apply it or they'll end up spam serving
[04-11-2006 23:02:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> when i get a free moment i'd i'mport the code into the svn :)
[04-11-2006 23:02:44] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> does anyone read it, don't you have a 2.2 community site still?
[04-11-2006 23:03:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i do, with a forum, hense my reference
[04-11-2006 23:03:08] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> right
[04-11-2006 23:03:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh and no ... no one does read the eZ 2.2 forum too hard to find, always being moved to a new url scheme (total bullshit fyi)
[04-11-2006 23:03:28] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I probably should try and check forgot my password area too :\
[04-11-2006 23:03:39] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> agree
[04-11-2006 23:03:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> *shrugs*
[04-11-2006 23:03:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i say days before an eZ meeting ..
[04-11-2006 23:04:00] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> is there a difference between strstr and !strstr
[04-11-2006 23:04:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but it just urked the hell out of me
[04-11-2006 23:04:10] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> heh, are you going to that?
[04-11-2006 23:04:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yes
[04-11-2006 23:04:34] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> cool, have a good time
[04-11-2006 23:04:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> wait a sec, i'm doing a skype call, not the conf
[04-11-2006 23:05:01] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> oh right
[04-11-2006 23:05:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> client's shift twice before i could commit, screwed my plans :\ i'm sure it's my fault
[04-11-2006 23:05:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> an, yes there is a difference beteween ! an without
[04-11-2006 23:05:57] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> Jo used !
[04-11-2006 23:06:44] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> hmm doesnt work at all with !
[04-11-2006 23:06:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> welll, http://us3.php.net/strstr
[04-11-2006 23:07:17] [#ezpublish] <kracker> If needle is not found, returns FALSE.
[04-11-2006 23:07:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so ... with ! it would say if not false
[04-11-2006 23:08:01] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> hmm interesting if (!stristr('Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday',$i)) die();
[04-11-2006 23:09:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> word
[04-11-2006 23:10:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'd be printing the strings you'd be trying to compare for differences
[04-11-2006 23:10:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i did add forum rss feed for ezcommunity.net
[04-11-2006 23:11:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> helps me, at least ;D
[04-11-2006 23:11:34] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> ok
[04-11-2006 23:12:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i also wonder if it isn't worth trying to fix the part of the code which adds the extra / instead of all this effort to support bad alternates
[04-11-2006 23:22:38] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> gosh php isnt easy. If this was ez template code I could write it in 2 mins, switch case match etc.
[04-11-2006 23:23:36] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> printing doesn't help, it just shows me what I already know.  ie. The URL in my browser, and the URL I typed in site.ini
[04-11-2006 23:24:01] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> maybe I have to build an array or something and search for a match there :(
[04-11-2006 23:30:58] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> any php programmers awake?
[04-11-2006 23:31:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hrm sounds too complicated what are you matching for
[04-11-2006 23:31:49] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> really, all I want to do is this.
[04-11-2006 23:32:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> $HTTP_REFERER can be null on first page view without referer fyi
[04-11-2006 23:32:11] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> If $HTTP_REFERER does not contain FromURL or FromURL2 then die
[04-11-2006 23:32:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but on a form submit it should .. tho
[04-11-2006 23:33:03] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> Jo's code does it really well if there is only one variable, ie. FormURL and not FormURL2 as well
[04-11-2006 23:33:37] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> initally HETTP_REFERER will be /article/articleview/3/1/1/
[04-11-2006 23:34:06] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> if it has to reload beacuse of validation error $HTTP_REFERER then becomes /form/form/process/1//
[04-11-2006 23:34:13] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> so both URL's need to be checked again
[04-11-2006 23:34:15] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> against
[04-11-2006 23:35:51] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I thought it was really basic php, but I'm in the dark
[04-11-2006 23:36:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'm hittin it
[04-11-2006 23:37:23] [#ezpublish] * Bedlore gathers around and starts kicking it as well
[04-11-2006 23:40:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> tryingto pm you man
[04-11-2006 23:40:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh
