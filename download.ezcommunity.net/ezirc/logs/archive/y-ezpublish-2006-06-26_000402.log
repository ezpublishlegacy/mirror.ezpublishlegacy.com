[06-24-2006 23:28:21] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. As you may be aware, freenode has experienced a crack attack and we're working on tracking down the details. At this point, we cannot guarantee that more problems will not occur.
[06-24-2006 23:29:53] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Once again I want to take the opportunity to mention that freenode could use more of its own hardware resources and more server hosting resources. If you'd like to help, please email staff@pdpc.us .... Thanks.
