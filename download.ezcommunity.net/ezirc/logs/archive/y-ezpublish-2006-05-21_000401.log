[05-19-2006 07:56:52] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> why do i get all those redirects after i change the Index Page node
[05-19-2006 07:57:26] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i get a redirect, sometimes two, after anything i do in the admin interface
[05-19-2006 07:58:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think one of the reasons is to take care of people hitting reload
[05-19-2006 07:58:33] [#ezpublish] <katana`> yep
[05-19-2006 07:58:35] [#ezpublish] <katana`> and reposting data
[05-19-2006 07:58:39] [#ezpublish] <katana`> which is a no no
[05-19-2006 07:59:01] [#ezpublish] <katana`> and it's due to the software architecture, too, redirecting to a view that performs an operation is better than duplicating the code
[05-19-2006 07:59:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> well that could be solved by simply calling that coe
[05-19-2006 07:59:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> code
[05-19-2006 08:00:50] [#ezpublish] <katana`> it's usually not that simple
[05-19-2006 08:01:04] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[05-19-2006 08:01:58] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i had only set Index Page, not the Default Page - seems better now :)

[05-19-2006 10:04:16] [#ezpublish] <xbit> :o

[05-19-2006 10:04:29] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hurley? :p
[05-19-2006 10:05:51] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> Well, perhaps you're ready to explain what is the common way to change the appearance of an object that I've crated from a class that I've made by myself.
[05-19-2006 10:09:48] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> "appearance" ?
[05-19-2006 10:09:53] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the icon in the tree ?
[05-19-2006 10:12:31] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> ahmm - no I meant the appearance on the site. I guess I need to do override templates?
[05-19-2006 10:12:48] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> but the icon would be interessting too.
[05-19-2006 10:12:53] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> ;)
[05-19-2006 10:12:58] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> for the icon, look into icon.ini
[05-19-2006 10:13:04] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> (ez, huh?)
[05-19-2006 10:13:18] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> ok. the icon.
[05-19-2006 10:13:23] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> and yes, for the appearance, you can use the templates overriding system
[05-19-2006 10:13:44] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> what can you use apart from this? I don't know in fact :)
[05-19-2006 10:14:28] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> I've just made a class tha contains a simple line of text. Ther's a kind of default view used to show that line.
[05-19-2006 10:14:50] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> But is it nessesary to write a new templatefile?
[05-19-2006 10:15:10] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the default template is used, and should never be overwritten
[05-19-2006 10:15:17] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so, what you can do, is:
[05-19-2006 10:15:35] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> *listening*
[05-19-2006 10:15:40] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> *typing*
[05-19-2006 10:16:14] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> < ...funny messages *
[05-19-2006 10:16:14] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> edit the override.ini file, create your own template, mention it in the ini file
[05-19-2006 10:16:25] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> ok.
[05-19-2006 10:16:33] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> that's all
[05-19-2006 10:16:56] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> I that there was a quicker way.
[05-19-2006 10:17:04] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> thout
[05-19-2006 10:17:46] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> well, thx a lot. I'll see how to do that.
