[03-21-2006 02:07:41] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I suspect the apache installation simply because thats what we've been screwing with, however ezp 3.x seems to work fine in this regard

[03-21-2006 04:23:11] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> how can i determine which version i'm using?
[03-21-2006 04:23:22] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> and which db version..
[03-21-2006 04:29:42] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> help..
[03-21-2006 04:39:22] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> Tiny_Toon: run the following command in your database: "select * from ezsite_data; " also check the version is in lib/version.php
[03-21-2006 04:42:22] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> hi kris10an,ok thanks..

[03-21-2006 06:23:35] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> sorry
[03-21-2006 06:23:46] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> version 3.3 release 5
[03-21-2006 06:24:11] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> i want to upgrade it to 3.6 of 3.7
[03-21-2006 06:24:14] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> i want to upgrade it to 3.6 or 3.7
[03-21-2006 06:30:22] [#ezpublish] <zrg> its the same thing
[03-21-2006 06:30:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ah, ok, TO 3.6 or 3.7, not from-to, sorry
[03-21-2006 06:31:58] [#ezpublish] <zrg> did you find upgrade instructions on ez.no ?
[03-21-2006 06:32:50] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> yes.. but it only had instructions on upgrading from a previous version
[03-21-2006 06:33:00] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> for eg from 3.6 to 3.7
[03-21-2006 06:33:56] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you had 3.3? that is from previous, no?
[03-21-2006 06:34:18] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> i have 3.3.5

[03-21-2006 06:46:39] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> Tiny_Toon: you need to do the upgrades sequencialy, 3.3 -> 3.5 -> 3.6 -> 3.7. i recommend you to use 3.7.x (which requires PHP 4.4)
[03-21-2006 06:46:53] [#ezpublish] <zrg> well yes that should work, backup everything including the db, then unpack new version over the old, run all the database scripts from old to new version and then go through scripts in update/common/scripts and find out which ones you need to run
[03-21-2006 06:48:02] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i recommend to use 3.6 and php 4.3, if you have it installed anyway
[03-21-2006 06:48:51] [#ezpublish] <zrg> 3.7 wont give anything extra but needs php upgrade which may break something, no need to make things complex
[03-21-2006 06:50:19] [#ezpublish] <zrg> also manually delete all caches before trying out upgraded version, delete var/cache and each var/siteaccess/cache
[03-21-2006 06:55:41] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> zrg: depends on your hardware/machine... if you get crashes randomly, you are affected by the referencebug in PHP 4.3. The only way to make sure you are not affected by that bug is to use 3.7
[03-21-2006 07:01:08] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yes, thats another matter
[03-21-2006 07:05:41] [#ezpublish] <Tiny_Toon> kris10an and zrg thanks!!

[03-21-2006 14:37:48] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I noticed that the default (standard + base) templates make use the so called "presentational markup" (i.e., dirty html with a lot of presentational stuff, like "align" and so on); I was wandering if someone has produced a cleanest version of such templates with neither presentational stuff nor stylesheets. It would be better for who prefers clean/semantic markup. Any suggestion/link/pointer/idea? Thanks.

[03-21-2006 17:08:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i know that Xrow is part of a template firm/project

[03-21-2006 17:09:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but your not the only one who has noticed this issue
[03-21-2006 17:09:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> infact the list is fairly long these days
[03-21-2006 17:09:41] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: and what's the best practice along this problem/issue? I mean, how do you cope wht that, for instance
[03-21-2006 17:10:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think in general they say it's good/ok to use out of the box but then also say pros should create their own designs from scratch using the plain sitedesign
[03-21-2006 17:10:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah ... cope (ahh the stories ...)
[03-21-2006 17:11:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'd say start from scratch implimenting your desired design using the plain sitedesign, it seems like it's a big hit but long term it provides the best results posible really
[03-21-2006 17:11:22] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: the PRO is definitely the possibility of using an out-of-the-box design, no doubts. But what about those, like me, preferring custom/clean markup? :-(
[03-21-2006 17:13:07] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: my hands are quite dirty inside all that amount of template/code but the results is not satisfactory; there are too much things/templates to take into account that one can't be sure to have finished. This is my main problem: "is there any other template I didn't take into account?"

[03-21-2006 19:25:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hrm, well we talked about this before
[03-21-2006 19:25:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it depends on the situation
[03-21-2006 19:25:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> changes to existing files already proven to accept changes
[03-21-2006 19:25:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> than i'd look to cache
[03-21-2006 19:26:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if it's a new file overide, i would closly check that the override is correct syntax (node/id/etc)
[03-21-2006 19:27:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> those used to throw me a lot aswell, lots of little things / details / ins an outs to that subsystem :?
[03-21-2006 19:28:13] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: ok but I checked with an empty override template and the -old- unempty one is still displayed instead of the empty one...
[03-21-2006 19:28:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> an i had to invest the time into learning it all, damn but all the free beer does not help keep it if you arn't using it often
[03-21-2006 19:30:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> are you override.ini at the top before any other instances? are you overriding an existing template, are you doing so properly ... sounds like it is not being overriden (like sry man, duhh you said that ..)
[03-21-2006 19:30:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> what file are you trying to override?
[03-21-2006 19:31:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> some times (gasp) i'll hack in a template first to prove it's the right one then revert my changes (version control, eh) ... then go create an override
[03-21-2006 19:32:33] [#ezpublish] <kracker> some templates are a nightmare to override differently in different situations (logic) but then that is in part (guess) why you can impliment templates in different ways (options) ignoring some of the limitation (i've hit but sigh can't recall)
[03-21-2006 19:33:52] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: the situation is really simple man, not so complicated. I include a file into pagelayout.tpl - and, apparently randomly, it change its view when I change the file and sometimes not
[03-21-2006 19:34:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, yeah i think i've seen that one
[03-21-2006 19:34:55] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: and how do you solve it?
[03-21-2006 19:35:06] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: it sometimes require the system to be restarted
[03-21-2006 19:35:43] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sry man those experiances (of mine) were well over 9 months ago :\ my brain is a bit to dusty to recall
[03-21-2006 19:35:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> tho restarting is crazyness
[03-21-2006 19:36:39] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: :\
[03-21-2006 19:37:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if your including a file (staticly) that should not (persay) require an override.ini setting (hell, might even conflict ?)
[03-21-2006 19:37:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i could be way off, just sounds like something is missing (i'm so on my way out ... right now)
[03-21-2006 19:38:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i would consider writing out a very clear statment of what exactly your doing (code examples plus) 3 - 4 paragraphs tops and posting a thread on ez.no to see what others might say in passing while you sleep *shrugs* helps keep movement while your fsckin
[03-21-2006 19:39:15] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: http://pastebin.com/615454
[03-21-2006 19:42:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> uhh, well i would recommend tracer bullets (numbers on each line?) (sure you prolly tried this, just in case the logic is in play)
[03-21-2006 19:42:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> looks like if you can also remove (var) you wouldn't notice a difference
[03-21-2006 19:43:01] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: yes
[03-21-2006 19:43:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'd also show your pagelayout.tpl snippet of the include
[03-21-2006 19:43:20] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: let me paste it please
[03-21-2006 19:43:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and mention what view your hitting
[03-21-2006 19:43:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nw
[03-21-2006 19:43:56] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: ok, it was a temporary effect
[03-21-2006 19:44:13] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I cleaned the cache (via command line) three times and it solved the problem :-)
[03-21-2006 19:44:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so but like on some views it doesn't include the file but in others it does (seeminly random)
[03-21-2006 19:44:16] [#ezpublish] <phretor> sorry man
[03-21-2006 19:44:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ouch, yeah me to but ... i'm down, i've been there, i really have, i was so #ezpublish back in the day
[03-21-2006 19:45:31] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: I also found that you can selectively disable/enable modules via [SiteAccessRules]
[03-21-2006 19:46:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'm not as leet as i was back then and far to rusty to be much more than a sounding board, but then that can be some what usefull (in a way, some times)
[03-21-2006 19:46:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> neat
[03-21-2006 19:47:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so you working on your first eZ app ?
[03-21-2006 19:47:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you been trailing eZ for long?
[03-21-2006 19:48:03] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: I'm just a webdesigner, I found eZ just a couple of months ago
[03-21-2006 19:48:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think the new 3.8 (?) develoment mode (for templates) will help with these kind of issues (checks tpl modification dates)
[03-21-2006 19:49:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think i got this from the mailling list or changelog (fyi)
[03-21-2006 19:49:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> right on
[03-21-2006 19:49:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ok well i have gotta crash, running on to little sleep :\
[03-21-2006 19:49:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> catch ya on the flip side
