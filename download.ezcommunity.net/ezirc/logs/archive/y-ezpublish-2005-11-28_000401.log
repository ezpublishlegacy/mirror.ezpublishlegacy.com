[11-26-2005 02:26:01] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> puh - it worked :) it seems :D
[11-26-2005 02:50:21] [#ezpublish] <_xiglet> how can I use url(image) in a stylesheet without a full url? Doesn't looks like I can use operators..
[11-26-2005 02:50:24] -!- _xiglet is now known as xiglet
[11-26-2005 02:51:28] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I wanted to use |ezdesign in the url

[11-26-2005 03:45:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> xiglet, are you trying to hide a url or just not have to specify a full url as a paramiter (variable base) or ... trying to understand
[11-26-2005 03:47:34] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> that last one
[11-26-2005 03:48:01] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> it's just so don't have to specify the full url
[11-26-2005 03:48:08] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> like we do in templates
[11-26-2005 03:48:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmmm
[11-26-2005 03:48:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i've ran into this one a little before and ... caved just to get through a milestone :\
[11-26-2005 03:50:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but it's been a while got an example of a full url (base, not domain) needed for the operator to work?
[11-26-2005 03:50:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> or your saying that you need to specifiy a full url +protocol+domain+basepath and which is the variable which you want ot be dynamic?
[11-26-2005 03:54:10] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> instead of url(http://domain.com/site/design/sitedesign/images/image.png)  i want something like url({image.png|ezdesign})
[11-26-2005 03:54:21] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> shouln't that work?
[11-26-2005 03:56:41] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> in a css override file that is
[11-26-2005 04:04:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ahh yes, this unique problem i now understand
[11-26-2005 04:04:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ok so what i say is this
[11-26-2005 04:04:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the problem is that your css is "static"
[11-26-2005 04:04:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and because it's static you run into problems when you desire a dynamic solution (course you know this ...)
[11-26-2005 04:05:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> why not have your css be created / cached dynamicly via php or eZ instead of using static css files?
[11-26-2005 04:06:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then it would be simple to make key parts of your css dynamic in this way
[11-26-2005 04:07:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i've done this before with php with good reasults, i've not done this using eZ publish yet but i do know that its' a topic that has been recommended by tony wood (and he would be someone who would have done this before, heh)
[11-26-2005 04:09:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sounds like a good place for an extention to parse / generate / cache css using the existing eZ publish higherarchy (not exactly a solution atm)
[11-26-2005 04:11:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if it was me i would just use php and mod_rewwrite to override your main css file, keeping the same url / uri ... but instead call a different file (php script) to output generated css) it would be really easy to do quickly
[11-26-2005 04:12:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> long term an extension for this would really be a beter way to go :\ but i'm not sure what the eZ way would be for handeling existing / stock css overrides ...:\
[11-26-2005 04:12:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then if i think aobut this long enough i know i'm forgeting one thing that makes my ideas pointless :\
[11-26-2005 04:13:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> can't you use relative css uri syntax?
[11-26-2005 04:51:52] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> yes I could, and I do. But wanted to do it the "correct way", if there is any...
[11-26-2005 04:52:00] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> with ez operators
[11-26-2005 05:09:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[11-26-2005 05:11:17] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't think any exist but it might be worth it to ask tony
[11-26-2005 05:11:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> errum reply to the thread on this subject (bring it back up in the forums)
[11-26-2005 05:12:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'd say it would be time to write up an extention to process a file in template syntax which stores and processes the tpl file and generates css as needed
[11-26-2005 05:12:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm idea
[11-26-2005 05:13:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> create (basicly empty) dummy content object say article
[11-26-2005 05:13:47] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then for that object create a set of template overrides so that your site-css.tpl file is used
[11-26-2005 05:14:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> this would let you use ez template language like your talking about
[11-26-2005 05:14:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then you could just set your css includes in your other main templates to point to the dynamic css generator
[11-26-2005 05:15:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the url of which would be the the dummy article
[11-26-2005 05:16:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> presto dynamic css using eZ publish and a little imagination, mix that with mod_rewrite to hide the actual url/uri, mix in more dummy articles for all kinds of css separation ...
[11-26-2005 05:17:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> eminem - stir crazy
[11-26-2005 05:18:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> just go crazy
[11-26-2005 05:18:40] [#ezpublish] * kracker gets back to work before my next leap
[11-26-2005 05:21:22] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i just use the url relative to the stylesheet, like url(../images/banner.jpg)

[11-26-2005 22:52:00] -dmwaters:$*- {global notice} Hi all! in an hour and 10 minutes, we've got some major upgrades to 3 of our main boxes. If everything goes right, it won't take more then 15 minutes. If things go wrong, well, it could take a little longer.:)  2 main rotation servers, and a hub will be impacted by these upgrades, as well as www.freenode.net and services. I will try to make this as quick as possible. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for using freenode
[11-26-2005 23:34:06] -dmwaters:$*- {global notice} This is a reminder that in about 25 minutes, 3 main servers will be rebooted for upgrades. This will not take long. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for using freenode!
[11-26-2005 23:42:35] -dmwaters:$*- {global notice} FYI, those of you who are using join throttling may want to disable it briefly durring the server upgrades in order to avoid people landing in overflow channels durring the upgrades.
