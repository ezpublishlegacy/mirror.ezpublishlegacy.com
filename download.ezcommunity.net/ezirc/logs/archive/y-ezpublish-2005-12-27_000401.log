[12-25-2005 12:37:38] [#ezpublish] <laleger> any forum members here?
[12-25-2005 12:38:00] [#ezpublish] <zrg> probably
[12-25-2005 12:39:14] [#ezpublish] <laleger> i'm having some trouble getting a few eZ 3.4+ sites working on a new shared host
[12-25-2005 12:40:31] [#ezpublish] <laleger> the index.php page does not seem to be taking any urls
[12-25-2005 12:41:21] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you've come to the man ;)
[12-25-2005 12:41:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> hang on
[12-25-2005 12:41:30] [#ezpublish] <laleger> all i can pull up is the main page regardless of what url is passed to index.php
[12-25-2005 12:41:31] [#ezpublish] <laleger> k
[12-25-2005 12:42:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> do you have, in your virtualhost:
[12-25-2005 12:42:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> AcceptPathInfo On
[12-25-2005 12:42:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ?
[12-25-2005 12:42:30] [#ezpublish] <laleger> actually, it's apache 1.3.x
[12-25-2005 12:42:37] [#ezpublish] <laleger> so it doesn't support that directive
[12-25-2005 12:43:05] [#ezpublish] <laleger> and php is running in cgi mode so i'm having to use mod_rewrite to make friendly urls
[12-25-2005 12:43:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, dunno then :)
[12-25-2005 12:43:59] [#ezpublish] <laleger> haha
[12-25-2005 12:44:05] [#ezpublish] <laleger> i wish it was that easy
[12-25-2005 12:44:21] [#ezpublish] <laleger> i got excited when i learned about that directive until i discovered it was only supported in apache 2
[12-25-2005 12:44:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> mod rewrite is black magick, i guess error is in there
[12-25-2005 12:45:02] [#ezpublish] <laleger> well i've remove my .htaccess file and tried passing any junk to index.php and it just loads the defaultpage
[12-25-2005 12:45:15] [#ezpublish] <laleger> i don't get the module errors that I suspect with a bad url
[12-25-2005 12:46:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> pass junk as with / after it?
[12-25-2005 12:47:49] [#ezpublish] <laleger> well since php is running in cgi mode now, i understand that urls are supposed to be like /index.php?/articles
[12-25-2005 12:48:43] [#ezpublish] <laleger> but none of the links work in that format and i don't get errors, just the default page
[12-25-2005 12:49:20] [#ezpublish] <laleger> i can go to /index.php?/blahblah or /index.php?blahblah
[12-25-2005 12:49:25] [#ezpublish] <laleger> and it just loads defaultpage
[12-25-2005 12:49:38] [#ezpublish] <zrg> cant really say, have tried searching forums?
[12-25-2005 12:49:58] [#ezpublish] <laleger> yup, submitted a post a few days ago on this specific problem with my .htaccess and haven't gotten any takers
[12-25-2005 12:50:10] [#ezpublish] <laleger> probably a bad time to change hosts before the holidays ;-)
[12-25-2005 12:52:05] [#ezpublish] <laleger> i didn't know if ez publish can automatically tell if a site is running in php-cgi mode after install
[12-25-2005 12:52:24] [#ezpublish] <laleger> or if i have to go make a change to one of the settings files to tell it to me looking for the ? in urls
[12-25-2005 12:55:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it should detect cgi and non-virtualhost situations at install
[12-25-2005 12:56:59] [#ezpublish] <laleger> correct, but i basically backed up my public_html dir (with the exception of the cache files in /var) and the mysql database, then i loaded everything on the new host and set perms to settings/var/design
[12-25-2005 12:57:44] [#ezpublish] <laleger> one of the sites is actually working right after i did a forcevirtualhost
[12-25-2005 12:57:56] [#ezpublish] <laleger> but it's eZ 3.5.x instead of 3.4.x
[12-25-2005 12:58:14] [#ezpublish] <laleger> the other sites are 3.4.x but I understand that 3.4 supports php-cgi mode
[12-25-2005 13:01:12] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i think you could do real install besides them too, see how it will be set up, then copy settings
[12-25-2005 13:01:51] [#ezpublish] <laleger> yea, i've thought about that
[12-25-2005 13:01:56] [#ezpublish] <laleger> that may be the ticket
[12-25-2005 13:02:13] [#ezpublish] <laleger> because i've compared settings between the working 3.5 site and the 3.4 sites and everything appears to be identical

[12-25-2005 14:46:24] [#ezpublish] <laleger> ez publish does support php in cgi mode in versions 3.4+ correct?
[12-25-2005 14:56:11] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i suppose so
[12-25-2005 14:56:24] [#ezpublish] <zrg> http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/documentation/configuration/security/non_virtualhost
[12-25-2005 14:56:24] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ?
[12-25-2005 15:14:24] [#ezpublish] <laleger> haha
[12-25-2005 15:14:25] [#ezpublish] <laleger> found it
[12-25-2005 15:14:34] [#ezpublish] <laleger> something stupid too
[12-25-2005 15:17:00] [#ezpublish] <laleger> i had arrays in override/site.ini.append.php that were not declared before they the values were defined
[12-25-2005 15:17:30] [#ezpublish] <laleger> forgot AvailableSiteAccessList[] before the sites were defined such as AvailableSiteAccessList[]=plain_user
[12-25-2005 15:18:06] [#ezpublish] <laleger> had the same mistake for HostMatchMapItems[] and SiteList[]
[12-25-2005 15:18:15] [#ezpublish] <laleger> not sure how those got to be the way they were before the backup
[12-25-2005 15:24:27] [#ezpublish] <laleger> ok, well that was bizarre
