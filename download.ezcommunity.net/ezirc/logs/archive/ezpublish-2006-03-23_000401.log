[03-22-2006 05:19:28] [#ezpublish] <phretor> re kracker
[03-22-2006 05:20:18] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I was wandering that it is possible to fetch user beloging to the current user group *but* I found no way for fetching users within a *given* group. Any help^
[03-22-2006 05:20:21] [#ezpublish] <phretor> ?
[03-22-2006 05:37:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> wow you caught me, impressed
[03-22-2006 05:37:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> say again:?
[03-22-2006 05:38:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> get a user group, find a specific user?
[03-22-2006 05:38:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> do you kno the user, group, both ... what are you starting with, what do you know
[03-22-2006 05:39:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> doh, i'm late
[03-22-2006 05:39:09] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: I only know the group (id/name)
[03-22-2006 05:39:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ok and say there are 10 yusers in the group
[03-22-2006 05:39:40] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: yep
[03-22-2006 05:39:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> which do you want (all, one, ?)
[03-22-2006 05:39:48] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: all
[03-22-2006 05:39:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> user that is ..
[03-22-2006 05:39:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[03-22-2006 05:39:58] [#ezpublish] <phretor> :-\
[03-22-2006 05:40:17] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: I'm going to lunch but my client will log all down all your ideas ;-) thanks as usual
[03-22-2006 05:40:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you dugg into pubsvn.ez.no doxygen docs before :\
[03-22-2006 05:40:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[03-22-2006 05:42:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> last ditch you could always grab all the users and loop to find the once in the group (but that seems like the hard way)
[03-22-2006 05:48:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hrm, not seeing this through google
[03-22-2006 05:49:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> well, think i would say groups are not really called groups in eZ
[03-22-2006 05:50:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> (breaks bottle over forhead)
[03-22-2006 05:50:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> they are called `roles`
[03-22-2006 05:51:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, i guess it helps to google for the right / applicable keywords
[03-22-2006 05:56:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hrm, sry i don't see this laying around already, this should be a tpl extension
[03-22-2006 05:56:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> or perhapse it's built in and i'm just missing it
[03-22-2006 05:56:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> doesn't seem like it would take too much to write tho
[03-22-2006 05:57:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> might want to throw a specifcly worded question into the forum (*shrugs*)
[03-22-2006 06:12:30] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> phretor: if you want to get all the users in a group, just do a normal fetch
[03-22-2006 06:13:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> any JS wizards around?
[03-22-2006 06:14:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> how in hell do you implement sleep(n seconds) in js??
[03-22-2006 06:14:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> and one for the flash lovers: anyone knows of open source flash slideshow thingies?
[03-22-2006 06:14:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> with neat effects and all that
[03-22-2006 06:18:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> thnx kris10an
[03-22-2006 06:19:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> lol, flash lovers

[03-22-2006 06:20:51] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kris10an: normal fetch? node fetch?
[03-22-2006 06:21:09] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> are you doing this from PHP or the templates?
[03-22-2006 06:21:57] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: note that 'roles' and 'groups' must not be confused!
[03-22-2006 06:23:12] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kris10an: from template
[03-22-2006 06:24:59] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hmm.. are you trying to fetch all users belonging to a user-group or to a specific role?
