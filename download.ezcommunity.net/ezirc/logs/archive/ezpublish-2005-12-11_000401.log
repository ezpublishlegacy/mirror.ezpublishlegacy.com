[12-10-2005 09:48:45] [#ezpublish] <zrg> the pain, the pain!
[12-10-2005 10:16:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> ?
[12-10-2005 10:16:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> is a dead raven stuck in your ass?
[12-10-2005 10:18:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no i had to pass town sqare
[12-10-2005 10:19:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> which is painful why?
[12-10-2005 10:19:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> too many dumb people?
[12-10-2005 10:19:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> have you seen http://triligon.org/triligon/projects/advancedforum/advancedforum_meta_forum/welcome_to_the_forum btw?
[12-10-2005 10:19:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> silent night blaring from megaphones, well i dont know for sure but the raven cant be more painful :P
[12-10-2005 10:21:22] [#ezpublish] <zrg> mm, nice
[12-10-2005 10:21:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm trying to figure out how to do ajax reply/edit
[12-10-2005 10:21:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> but thats hard because of the redirect
[12-10-2005 10:26:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> unless i do hack something myself...
[12-10-2005 10:26:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> which just might do ;)
[12-10-2005 10:43:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> is there a way to define permissions for individual rss feeds not just all or nothing?
[12-10-2005 10:44:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> or does it inherit the perms of content module?
[12-10-2005 10:48:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> seems like it does
[12-10-2005 10:54:34] [#ezpublish] <zrg> that seems not to work, buz.. post it in forum :P
[12-10-2005 10:55:00] -!- Katana` [n=katana@lns-bzn-49f-81-56-163-176.adsl.proxad.net] has joined #ezpublish
[12-10-2005 10:56:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> posted it there, yes
[12-10-2005 10:56:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> be quick it's gonna be deleted in a few minutes
[12-10-2005 11:05:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> had to look up lyrics :P
[12-10-2005 11:12:59] [#ezpublish] <zrg> all i wanna do is to have different node as indexpage for each of several sitenames that points to site, why must i define siteaccesses :(
[12-10-2005 11:13:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> you could do it template code you know
[12-10-2005 11:13:36] [#ezpublish] <zrg> hmm
[12-10-2005 11:13:43] [#ezpublish] <zrg> redirect?
[12-10-2005 11:13:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> na just fetch the proper node
[12-10-2005 11:13:56] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no actually
[12-10-2005 11:14:00] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yes
[12-10-2005 11:14:01] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yes
[12-10-2005 11:14:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> then call node_view_gui
[12-10-2005 11:14:28] [#ezpublish] <zrg> mhmh, i get it, kind of obvious :)
[12-10-2005 11:14:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> still a hack but easier
[12-10-2005 11:16:05] [#ezpublish] <zrg> or then not, menus and such use module result node id, they wont be fooled
[12-10-2005 11:16:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> you said first object
[12-10-2005 11:16:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> not whole site ;)
[12-10-2005 11:16:48] [#ezpublish] <zrg> could overwrite that id maybe..
[12-10-2005 11:17:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> or then maybe doing the stupid siteaccess and linking all files except one with indexpage def is nicer :P
[12-10-2005 11:18:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh i'm back to kernel hacking it seems
[12-10-2005 11:18:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont like that at all
[12-10-2005 11:18:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> afraid of several siteaccesses tho, twice ive tried it it fcked up site
[12-10-2005 12:21:29] [#ezpublish] <zrg> fh, kh, any of you guys alive?  Does ANYONE know what the NodeSettings/RootNode setting does?
[12-10-2005 12:42:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think it defines the rootnode for the siteaccess
[12-10-2005 12:53:05] [#ezpublish] <zrg> as far as i have tried and some others on forums it has no visible effect
[12-10-2005 12:53:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> you need another one for defining the first node being shown
[12-10-2005 12:53:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> cant remember which one though
[12-10-2005 12:55:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you mean IndexPage and DefaultPage
[12-10-2005 12:56:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> they work
[12-10-2005 12:57:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> then whats the issue
[12-10-2005 12:58:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> issue is even if i set them all, nodes above what i have set as root are still visible everywhere
[12-10-2005 12:58:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm wondering if there's a way to have a user decide who can read the stuff he writes?
[12-10-2005 12:59:10] [#ezpublish] <zrg> one person or group?
[12-10-2005 12:59:19] [#ezpublish] <zrg> internal messaging?
[12-10-2005 12:59:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> no more like this gallery i'll show to x,y,z but this one only to q and r
[12-10-2005 12:59:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> think access control lists
[12-10-2005 13:00:32] [#ezpublish] <zrg> not hard to do in template of course
[12-10-2005 13:00:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> template "security" is evil (tm)
[12-10-2005 13:01:16] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yes, alternative is kernel hacking ;)
[12-10-2005 13:01:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> i've been there
[12-10-2005 13:01:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's ugly
[12-10-2005 13:01:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> and doing it right means rewriting most of the stuff from scratch i fear
[12-10-2005 13:02:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe i could write an ACL data type and hack the kernel to use that one
[12-10-2005 13:02:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> attribute level permissions is another thing i'd love to see
[12-10-2005 13:18:01] [#ezpublish] <zrg> remove all attributes from classes and replace them with one-field classes under the original class, then define access to each of them the ordinary way :)
[12-10-2005 13:18:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> *ducks*
[12-10-2005 13:18:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's gonna be very efficient
[12-10-2005 13:18:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it IS possible tho :)
