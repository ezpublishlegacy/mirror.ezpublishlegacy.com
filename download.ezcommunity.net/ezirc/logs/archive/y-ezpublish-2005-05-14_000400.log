[05-12-2005 14:04:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> kickin
[05-12-2005 14:04:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> so i think i figured it out last night
[05-12-2005 14:05:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> i was talking to a member of out netops team and he says that it's basicly NAT deviced that are responsible for my constant disconnects
[05-12-2005 14:05:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> errum s/deviced/devices/
[05-12-2005 14:05:40] [#ezpublish] <_buz> what kind of device have you got
[05-12-2005 14:05:46] [#ezpublish] <_buz> or is it at their side?
[05-12-2005 14:06:08] [#ezpublish] <_buz> if you need a router, get the linksys wrt54g
[05-12-2005 14:06:19] [#ezpublish] <_buz> runs on linux and has got a wide range of custom firmwares available
[05-12-2005 14:06:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> so i'm avaoiding connecting through them by using ssh as a tunnel to another server (thus avoiding irc through NAT problems)
[05-12-2005 14:06:28] [#ezpublish] <_buz> or asus wl500 which even comes with an usb port
[05-12-2005 14:06:33] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> seems ssh is not affected like irc through NAT
[05-12-2005 14:06:38] [#ezpublish] <_buz> mhh that's weird
[05-12-2005 14:06:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> normally nat doesn't affect irc at all
[05-12-2005 14:06:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> i'm using two residential devices
[05-12-2005 14:07:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> ummm, a really really old netgear dumb 802.11b (house) and mine ( another more recent and popular netgear 802.11g
[05-12-2005 14:08:01] [#ezpublish] <_buz> mhh the netgear disconnects after a few minutes of inactivity
[05-12-2005 14:08:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> it seems like he was saying that nat lets the connection drop out after a few min of inactivity
[05-12-2005 14:09:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> an the 'router' (not really a router, tho) doesn't support a paramiter to override / controll this behavior (none of them do really ...)
[05-12-2005 14:09:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> tho, i'd almost wager that its a bit vendor specific (per say?)
[05-12-2005 14:09:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> anyway bollix to localhost mIRC, say hello to server-side bItch'ing

[05-12-2005 14:11:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> :)
[05-12-2005 14:11:12] [#ezpublish] <_buz> my linksys doesn't seem to drop nat connections
[05-12-2005 14:11:17] [#ezpublish] <_buz> neither did freebsd based routers
[05-12-2005 14:11:19] [#ezpublish] <_buz> the netgear did
[05-12-2005 14:11:28] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but if you can have it generate ping signals, it's fine
[05-12-2005 14:11:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker_> and i don't remember my linksys doing it either but it's been a while since i dusted it off, when i move again i'll put it into degraded production for testing

[05-12-2005 22:29:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so anyone ever been in legal battle over an eZ publish application / project?
[05-12-2005 22:29:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the crowd laughs
[05-12-2005 22:30:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i was checking my voice mail today for the first time in a about 4 days (plane trip + fedex shipment of forgotten cell phone) and ...
[05-12-2005 22:31:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i get this call from a client from a former project (not the greatest client in terms of their love for all things outside our signed scope of work / contract)
[05-12-2005 22:32:17] [#ezpublish] <kracker> turns out they think that negligence on their part (deleteing a system / admin account)
[05-12-2005 22:32:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> falls under their lawyers radar to sue me
[05-12-2005 22:32:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's funny really :P
[05-12-2005 22:33:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i tried to sell them on a fair training / documentation / support / maintinence contract for the past 10 months ...
[05-12-2005 22:34:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> they wouldn't negotiate, just wanted the app (pure dev contract) so they got it

[05-12-2005 22:36:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i've never seen a client so upset that i warned them that development was only part of the picture in a web application long term life span
[05-12-2005 22:37:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i even restored the application (at no cost) within 10 hours of their foolish clicking
[05-12-2005 22:37:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but now, i'm the son of a bitch
