[01-23-2006 05:34:02] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> but you can create an entry in the primary language (even empty), translate it, and then destroy the translation in the primary language
[01-23-2006 05:34:53] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> mm, or if you have one admin side for each language, you may do it directly
[01-23-2006 05:36:27] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> that's what I thought. :-\ well, tnx
[01-23-2006 05:44:13] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hey guys. anyone knows what is the setting to limit the "preview siteaccesses" an user can see in the admin site, when previewing content?
