[07-05-2006 07:27:07] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi
[07-05-2006 07:27:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I have 2 siteaccesses
[07-05-2006 07:27:29] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> one for each available language
[07-05-2006 07:27:49] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> how inside the pagelayout can I determine in which siteaccess I am in order to display the current language?
[07-05-2006 07:33:28] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> kalooni: you saw that article? http://ez.no/community/articles/new_features_in_ez_publish_3_8
[07-05-2006 07:33:53] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes I just check it ;)
[07-05-2006 07:33:57] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> maybe it has the answer, if not, you can also ask in a comment to it
[07-05-2006 07:33:57] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> thanks
[07-05-2006 07:34:19] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> It is perfect but does not really fit my needs
[07-05-2006 07:34:32] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> as I am not using URI but HOST
[07-05-2006 07:35:10] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I will use $site.http_equiv.Content-language in a if condition to be able to display what I want
