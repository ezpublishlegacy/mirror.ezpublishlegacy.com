[04-12-2006 09:29:57] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: what's your limit?
[04-12-2006 09:30:08] [#ezpublish] <katana`> 60 or 90
[04-12-2006 09:30:20] [#ezpublish] <katana`> or none but this is risky you never know what may happen
[04-12-2006 09:30:31] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: make it 70 ;-)
[04-12-2006 09:30:58] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: I'll also ask root for an optimizer
[04-12-2006 09:31:07] [#ezpublish] <katana`> yeah that would be nice
[04-12-2006 09:36:35] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: do you use any optimizer?
[04-12-2006 09:38:01] [#ezpublish] <katana`> yeah
[04-12-2006 09:38:02] [#ezpublish] <katana`> always
[04-12-2006 09:38:09] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: which one?
[04-12-2006 09:44:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> eaccelerator is good
[04-12-2006 09:44:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually, 30s was enough for most of my installs
[04-12-2006 09:44:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> but all of them are on fast servers
[04-12-2006 10:06:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> on my 3.7.2 install, I need a memory limit of 256 mb on admin siteaccess for it to work ... with eAccelerator, while with zend platform, even more :)

[04-12-2006 10:19:39] [#ezpublish] <phretor> which dirs should be writable from webserver? var/, design/, settings/, whatever?
[04-12-2006 10:26:23] [#ezpublish] <phretor> Sulfur: my server is a dual Xeon with 2G of RAM :-\

[04-12-2006 10:29:16] [#ezpublish] <katana`> var/ should be enough
[04-12-2006 10:29:31] [#ezpublish] <katana`> settings/override/ too if you wanna use the developer toolbar
[04-12-2006 10:30:00] [#ezpublish] <katana`> all of settings/ and design/ if you want to use more features of the admin interface (create templates, etc). Otherwise it is not required, just var/ is
[04-12-2006 10:32:16] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: the server admin is bothering me about script quality :-\ how could I explain him that eZpublish is actually well written and that these problems are machine issues?
[04-12-2006 10:38:54] [#ezpublish] <katana`> errr
[04-12-2006 10:39:25] [#ezpublish] <katana`> you should not say that exactly, but instead that eZ publish has more requirements on the hardware and software setup than the average script
[04-12-2006 10:39:57] [#ezpublish] <katana`> once everything is setup correctly, eZ publish DOES work fine and doesn't kill the server more than it should
[04-12-2006 10:40:22] [#ezpublish] <katana`> now don't expect him to believe that eZ publish uses the same resources as an average script... it has more features, and definitely uses much more resources, but it is worth it :)
[04-12-2006 10:41:04] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: I know, you know...now I got to make him eZ publish aware :-D

[04-12-2006 11:12:09] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> a question concerning the search: what happen if I do search for 2 words ?
