[01-17-2006 08:29:21] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> hi all :)
[01-17-2006 08:29:31] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> is there a way to change published date ?
[01-17-2006 08:36:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hehe
[01-17-2006 08:36:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i thought i saw an extension for that recently :?
[01-17-2006 08:43:30] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ah ?
[01-17-2006 09:14:32] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> where are extensioin ?
[01-17-2006 09:28:10] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> in an ezpublish site, I need to have some PDF available for download. The problem is that those PDF are generated by a completely external script.
[01-17-2006 09:28:45] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> What's the best option to have them available with an url like: http://mysite/pdf/mypdf.pdf ?
[01-17-2006 09:28:52] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> is there anything special I should take care of ?

[01-17-2006 10:12:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> seasonfive, oops i guess not (after looking a little) sry but it's prollly possible with a bit of hacking of either templates (i wish), kernel (prolly) or write a php-cli script to do it
[01-17-2006 10:13:23] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> need to be reachable by web for my need ... :-/
[01-17-2006 10:14:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then i'd head towards editing the admin templates to provide for it : but it sounds like a job for a all round extension :0
[01-17-2006 10:14:43] [#ezpublish] <kracker> B-KiLLer`, mod rewrite to allow for the url style you need (fairly simple)
[01-17-2006 10:17:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> seasonfive, i dunno ifthis will help or hinder ya http://ez.no/community/contribs/hacks/ezdatetimeselect
