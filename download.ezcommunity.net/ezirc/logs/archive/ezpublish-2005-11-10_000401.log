[11-09-2005 03:27:00] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> the width of an div (sat in em) is narrower than in all otehr browers. Normally I would not bother with it, but my boss uses just that browser and he wants it right

[11-09-2005 03:53:25] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I am trying www.mysite.com/content/tipafriend/my/node/url_alias
[11-09-2005 03:53:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but maybe it's not the correct way
[11-09-2005 04:00:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> eh, i'm no help on that one :P sry, last i paid attention to that tidbit of functionality was how to dissable it via settings / ini

[11-09-2005 04:16:02] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I'll take advantage of fh[eZ] being "here" .... how to change automated tipafriend email subjects without kernel hacking? and can email templates be overridden?
[11-09-2005 04:17:19] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> Sulfur: 1. Don't know, you need to check if the tipafriend functionality checks for some variable in the e-mail template. 2. yes
[11-09-2005 04:22:15] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yay, found it

[11-09-2005 08:15:05] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kh[eZ]: yes I managed it and put a comment on doc :)
[11-09-2005 08:16:06] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> as for now, my editors can create an object, but when they press the insert link button, the popup shows a permission error (Kernel 1)
[11-09-2005 08:17:02] [#ezpublish] <kh[eZ]> add access to ezdhtml module for your editors
[11-09-2005 08:19:26] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> why can my editor access the OE even before having the permission for it, kh[eZ] ?
[11-09-2005 08:19:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> showing OE itself doesn't require permissions
[11-09-2005 08:19:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> using the OE module / views requires them
[11-09-2005 08:20:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> e.g. anything that opens a popup, basically
[11-09-2005 08:20:25] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> that does not strike me as coherent. this means that I have to enable it for all content-wielding users '
[11-09-2005 08:20:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ?
[11-09-2005 08:20:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> for all those who should be able to access OE yes ..
[11-09-2005 08:20:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> showing the OE itself only requires templating
[11-09-2005 08:21:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and there are no permissions on that
[11-09-2005 08:21:28] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hm.
[11-09-2005 08:21:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> stop me if i'm wrong kh[eZ]
[11-09-2005 08:22:16] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> no, Katana`, it seems to me that you are right, yet it does not feel "right" .
[11-09-2005 08:22:24] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> anyway, now that I know ...
[11-09-2005 08:22:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> handling more than that will be for really really later on i think :)
[11-09-2005 08:31:35] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kh[eZ]: I see that this policy requirement  is not mentioned in install / FAQ of OE
