[06-14-2006 05:26:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> I am trying to make an approval workflow work, with little success: I have some questions .. 1) is it possible to have more than one approving user for content? 2) user A writes an article which needs to be approved by user B. Article appears in the to-do list of user A, but no trace of any task appears in the to-do list of user B , so he cannot do anything ... what am I doing wrong ?

[06-14-2006 06:43:49] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hi all
[06-14-2006 06:44:15] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> quick question: is it possible to give anonymous access to a specified siteaccess, using the .ini configuration files ?
[06-14-2006 06:44:37] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> for a very strange & unknow reason, when I do a mysql dump of the entire database, and then import it on another server,
[06-14-2006 06:45:04] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> my settings in the roles and policies are modified, and I'm left with only one site access with anon access authorized
[06-14-2006 06:45:38] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> black magic
[06-14-2006 06:46:09] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yeah, seems to be :)
[06-14-2006 06:46:21] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I found that setting, right about now: PolicyOmitList[]=user/login
[06-14-2006 06:46:26] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> maybe it could suit my needs
[06-14-2006 06:46:43] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> (yes, I'm auto-answering my questions ;) )
[06-14-2006 06:46:48] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> lol
[06-14-2006 06:47:17] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> c'est pas normal que ça te fasse ça, je chercerais le problème a ta place
[06-14-2006 06:47:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> perhaps your database is corrupt
[06-14-2006 06:47:45] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> huhu, was that second sentence hard to say in english ? :p
[06-14-2006 06:47:45] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> or it isn't the right database :)
[06-14-2006 06:47:53] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes
[06-14-2006 06:47:56] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> it's completely the right one, no errors on dump
[06-14-2006 06:48:03] [#ezpublish] * DiGiTa|_ set mode feignasse "on"

[06-14-2006 06:48:33] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> did you clear all the cache ?
[06-14-2006 06:49:29] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yes, but it's the admin part that I can clearly see the missing siteaccesses in user/login
[06-14-2006 06:50:02] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> that's strange

[06-14-2006 08:41:08] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> question for the runcronjobers out there .....  is it normal to have the runcronjobs.php running since 1.5 hours ?
[06-14-2006 08:42:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> the ezsearch_object_word_link keeps changing cardinality (it's not a live site), so I think maybe it's indexing the content, but I am also rather wary of  phpMyAdmin's count-rows accuracy
