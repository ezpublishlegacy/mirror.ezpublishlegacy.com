[05:05] <kracker> ok
[05:05] <kracker> i'll look into that
[05:05] <kracker> any suggestions on what you (only) want to see instead of what you don't want to see?
[05:08] <SEAwolfx_> ;)
[05:09] <SEAwolfx_> in ez i want to see the urls linked ;)
[05:10] <kracker> naturaly
[05:11] <kracker> along with per user searching / display of #ezpublish conversations (connecting forums users to irc handles) and then conversations / messagses ... ?
[05:12] <SEAwolfx_> yeah ;)
[05:17] <kracker> oh yeah!
[05:57] * kracker testing to see if i got kicked again ...

[05:57] <seasonfive> Hi ppl :)
[05:57] <seasonfive> I've got a little problem with unordered list inside article
[05:57] * Quits: ordna1 (~ordnas@p549DFAA2.dip.t-dialin.net) (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[05:57] <seasonfive> i.e: <ul><li>test 1</li><li>test 2</li></ul>
[05:57] <seasonfive> ezpublish render that:
[05:57] <seasonfive> <ul><li><p>test 1</p></li><li><p>test 2</p></li></ul>
[05:57] <seasonfive> and on the li.tpl there is no <p> tags ...
[05:57] <seasonfive> i'm using 3.5.1
[05:57] <SEAwolfx_> its seems that the object is rendering itself with a <p> tag?
[05:57] <kracker> nods
[05:58] <seasonfive> absolutely
[05:58] <kracker> it's been covered several times in the forums 
[05:58] <seasonfive> when i do <li><litteral>test</literal></li> there is no more this pb
[05:58] <kracker> it's buit into the templates, you can override it / edit the template to prevent it ( i think ...)
[05:59] <SEAwolfx_> not possible imho
[05:59] <seasonfive> as the <p> tags are added by ezpublish itself and not by template ...
[05:59] <SEAwolfx_> li.tpl is elementary
[05:59] <seasonfive> absolutly, there is no <p> in li.tpl
[06:00] <seasonfive> am i the only one to care about this pb (not so important for sure ...) ?
[06:00] <seasonfive> because i don't see anything related to that ...
[06:01] <SEAwolfx_> seasonfive: prolly you could use the strip template-operator to clean it?
[06:01] <seasonfive> hmm what is ? (i'm going to search that on the doc ...)
[06:01] <kracker> http://ez.no/community/bugs/paragraph_tags_included_in_unordered_list
[06:02] <seasonfive> kracker: i dont understant the answer ... %-)
[06:02] <seasonfive> " The li</li> tag works in similar as the (hidden) <i>section tag, this means that the tag consists of paragraphs, headers, tables etc."
[06:03] * SEAwolfx_ thinks of the wash template-operator ..
[06:03] <kracker> well what i mean is 
[06:04] <kracker> that it's there for a lame reason
[06:04] <seasonfive> i've got {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.body} for render article
[06:04] <kracker> it's to support multi paragraph list items which some people ( yeah we know you you are ..) apparently use
[06:04] <seasonfive> i didn't succeed to do something like {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.body|wash}
[06:04] <kracker> no that won't do it for ya really 
[06:05] <kracker> now i want to say your going to need to hack the gibson! errum the kernel
[06:05] <seasonfive> so <p> in <li> is horrible at display ... :-/
[06:05] <SEAwolfx_> isnt there a regexstrip operator?
[06:05] <kracker> looking for a direction to send ya
[06:05] <seasonfive> i didn't found where this <p> is added ...
[06:06] <kracker> http://www.ez.no/community/forum/developer/p_tags_included_in_unordered_list
[06:06] <seasonfive> (moreover it is not added when i add <literral> ! strange isn't it ?)
[06:06] <kracker> seriuosly, a good 5min on google.com with the search keywords (without quotes) : "site:ez.no unordered list "
[06:06] <SEAwolfx_> seasonfive: u could use the remove operator as a workaround
[06:08] <seasonfive> something like <li>{$content|remove('<p>', '</p>')}</li> ?
[06:08] <kracker> that last link has a css solution (which avoids the inclusion of the <p> tag via css properties)
[06:09] <kracker> you can't do that inside eZ xml (GOD I WISH)
[06:09] <SEAwolfx_> seasonfive: http://ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/reference/template_operators/strings/remove
[06:09] <seasonfive> (thanks a LOT for your help guys ! :))
[06:09] <kracker> not ezxml, that's ez template language
[06:09] <kracker> there is a difference
[06:10] <kracker> in where your trying to insert your custom solution
[06:10] <seasonfive> is remove support negative offset ? :p
[06:10] <SEAwolfx_> why negative?
[06:10] <seasonfive> for </p>
[06:11] <SEAwolfx_> just switch two remove operator in serial
[06:11] <seasonfive> <p>test</p>|remove(0, 3)
[06:11] <seasonfive> give test</p> isn't it ?
[06:11] <SEAwolfx_> ahh
[06:11] <SEAwolfx_> damn
[06:12] <seasonfive> test</p>|remove(-3, 4)
[06:12] <seasonfive> should return test
[06:13] <SEAwolfx_> http://ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/reference/template_operators/strings/extract_left
[06:13] <SEAwolfx_> ;)
[06:13] <SEAwolfx_> and extract_right
[06:13] <SEAwolfx_> damn neither
[06:14] <seasonfive> yes its nice ! :)
[06:14] <seasonfive> ah no
[06:14] <seasonfive> lol
[06:14] <SEAwolfx_> ;)))))))))9
[06:14] <seasonfive> i just keep <p> and </p> lol
[06:14] <SEAwolfx_> true
[06:14] <seasonfive> perhaps combined with a "not" operator ... ;)
[06:14] <SEAwolfx_> yeah
[06:14] <SEAwolfx_> idk
[06:15] <seasonfive> seems negative offset working ...
[06:16] <seasonfive> yeah that's work !!
[06:16] <seasonfive> <li>{$content|remove(0, 4)|remove(-5, 4)}</li>
[06:16] <SEAwolfx_> yeah .. cool.
[06:16] <seasonfive> yeah nice 100% pure hacking lol
[06:16] <seasonfive> for remove something which should not be there ...
[06:17] <SEAwolfx_> true
[06:17] <seasonfive> i've got another pb :p
[06:17] <SEAwolfx_> urghs
[06:17] <kracker> you guys are weird ...
[06:17] <seasonfive> string with ' aren't converted into &...
[06:18] <seasonfive> and then my code isn't xhtml valid ... :(
[06:19] * Parts: daffen (~bob@213.184.199.226)
[06:20] <SEAwolfx_> this would be a bug.
[06:20] <SEAwolfx_> so u have to hack into the xml-text parser.
[06:21] <SEAwolfx_> much fun and luck *duck*
[06:21] <seasonfive> same for accent ...
[06:21] <seasonfive> they are render as they had writtent
[06:21] <seasonfive> |wash(xhtml) ?
[06:21] <seasonfive> seems another hack too ... :(
[06:21] <SEAwolfx_> or try this ... this sounds good
[06:22] <seasonfive> yeah but don't works ...
[06:22] <seasonfive> {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.body|wash(xhtml)} return absolutly nothing
[06:22] <seasonfive> because body is an object ...
[06:23] <seasonfive> i think ezpublish will make me crazy :p
[06:23] <seasonfive> in fact i think its more a admin bug than a render bug
[06:23] <SEAwolfx_> dont use attribute_view_gui then
[06:24] <seasonfive> since i think data must be stored with &xxx equivalent in the db
[06:24] <SEAwolfx_> so hack the code ;)
[06:24] <seasonfive> otherwise will be problem with <tag> &lt;tag&gt;
[06:24] <kracker> "what don't kill me will just make me crazier ..." 
[06:25] <SEAwolfx_> ;)
[06:26] <kracker> what don't kill me will just make crazier</bold>, i'm so filthy, sorry you had to see me like this, i sold you a lie that showed through my eyes and told you to cry in stained glass suicide ... i just wish i could forget how to read behind the cracks ..."
[06:26] <kracker> Eyedea And Abilities : E And A : Glass
[06:28] <seasonfive> in fact i'm suprised to see problem like this in a software like ezpublish in a v3 version ... ?
[06:28] <seasonfive> it's why i thinked the problem come from me
[06:29] <seasonfive> more over, in ezpublish web site " are well replaced by &quot;
[06:30] <seasonfive> hmmm ... " are replaced but ' isn't ...
[06:36] <kracker> remember v3 is an odd version number and no offence but eZ publish pre 3.5.2 was so unstable it was discusting

[06:37] * Quits: _luke (~Luke@ntwklan-62-233-244-90.devs.futuro.pl) (Client Quit)
[06:37] <kracker> in most software development shops these days a number of people say that odd version numbers are always unstable
[06:38] <kracker> welll thats not really true but from a number of user perpectives life was really really hard pre 3.4.0
[06:39] <kracker> but what your not hearing me and everyone else say "seasonfive" is that it's a negative feature which eZ systems likes and supports even if it has some negative side affects for others ..... they mean it to be this way
[06:40] <kracker> course i'm still stuck on the whole ul/p tag thing and your several steps past it and into other issues ... so i'm prolly answering in delay 
[06:42] <kracker> i'm such a bastard 
[06:44] <seasonfive> hhmm sorry i'm french and in fact i don't understand everything ...
[06:44] <seasonfive> is it something like "don't blame, ezpublish, you are using a devel version. If you're not happy, hack de code and contribute" ?
[06:46] * Joins: ordna1 (~ordnas@p549DFAA2.dip.t-dialin.net)
[06:47] <seasonfive> for finish with "critic" : i don't understand why template languages of ezpublish isn't using xml tags (something like phptal)
[06:48] <xbit> why?!
[06:48] <xbit> oh why... :0
[06:48] <seasonfive> because this permis to works correctly into dreamweaver
[06:48] <seasonfive> <img src="C:/windows/mypicture/imdesigner.gif"> in the designer post
[06:48] <xbit> suckysucky
[06:49] <fh> how to know what is XML and what is HTML?
[06:49] <xbit> dreamweavers fault
[06:49] <xbit> use a decent editor
[06:49] <xbit> :)
[06:49] <seasonfive> and <img src={imdesigner.gif|ezimage}> on the developper computer
[06:49] <SEAwolfx_> u could config dreamweaver to check eztemplate
[06:49] <xbit> why the hell can't dw cope with {} ?!
[06:49] <xbit> sounds like a really stupid piece of sw if it doesn't...
[06:49] <SEAwolfx_> it can
[06:50] <SEAwolfx_> fh: is konqueror and webdav working properly for you?
[06:50] <kracker> seasonfive: what i mean is that eZ publish has come a long way and still has a LOT of growning up left to do 
[06:51] <kracker> Also not all solutions work for all people, so pacience and tempered responces are best 
[06:51] <seasonfive> <title tal:content="title">place for the page title</title>
[06:51] <kracker> as aposed to going off like a bomb (or like me on an off day ..)
[06:51] <seasonfive> in dreaweaver the title is displayed correctly
[06:51] <seasonfive> and on the developer computer there is no more to do search/replace
[06:52] <seasonfive> hey, i'm really happy with ezpublish
[06:52] <fh> SEAwolfx_: no idea.. can't test right now (I guess so, I tested it with 3.5.1 a couple of weeks back)
[06:52] <seasonfive> it's really a good software
[06:52] <SEAwolfx_> fh: some folders are treated like files that doesnt allow me to browse into
[06:52] <kracker> but then you don't have to take my word for it :)
[06:53] <seasonfive> in fact i'm only surprised how difficult things are done very well when other like XHTML conversion aren't done ...
[06:53] <SEAwolfx_> fh: Could not access /web/Content/Projects/Tob%20Jona%20&%20DJ%20Pheromone/ (not WebDAV-enabled?)
[06:53] <SEAwolfx_> with cadaver
[06:53] <fh> SEAwolfx_: check your settings.. maybe you have setup these classes to be treated like files, not folders
[06:53] <seasonfive> ezPublish learn me a lot about php/OO technics
[06:53] <SEAwolfx_> fh: its simply a folder.
[06:54] <fh> seasonfive: wait until publish 4
[06:54] <fh> that will show you something about OO :)
[06:54] <SEAwolfx_> juhuu php5
[06:55] <seasonfive> i'm just sad about i'm cannot put a W3C XHTML 1.0 compliant logo on my website :p 
[06:56] <seasonfive> btw, thanks a lot for your help !
[06:59] <kracker> you can you just have to work for it, (watch me eat those words later ...)

[23:43] <SEAwolfx_> hehe
[23:45] <SEAwolfx_> what is ezpub?
[23:46] <SEAwolfx_> ezpub.co.uk
[23:46] <SEAwolfx_> ur project?
[23:46] <kracker> yeah
[23:46] <kracker> the "eZ pub" was one of the first eZ publish (v3) community portals
[23:46] <kracker> it lived and died a quick death from lack of community support
[23:46] <SEAwolfx_> i could imagine
[23:47] <kracker> it did some good work, and reminded me a lot of my eZ publish 3 learning back in 2002
[23:47] <SEAwolfx_> a ez-wiki would also be nice.
[23:47] <kracker> i've since moved on to other eZ projects for the community, i'll clean up the mess i left very shortly
[23:48] <kracker> checkout http://snippets.ezpublishhosting.com/
[23:49] <kracker> one day i'll find someone to fund me ;)
[23:49] <kracker> errum s/fund/finance/

[23:50] <kracker> i'm  planning to move the conent and solutions from ezpub into other beter branded applications with a lot more features, it's going to be cool
[23:50] <kracker> s/conent/content/
[23:52] <SEAwolfx_> cool, i am excited.
[23:52] <SEAwolfx_> when it will be finished?
[23:55] <kracker> eesh, hard to say when you have to run so hard to just pay for cost of living and doing nothing but eZ publish dev/doc/and more 
[23:55] <SEAwolfx_> you are a freelancer?
[23:57] <kracker> yes
[23:57] <kracker> been doing eZ publish development since 1.0 (2001)
