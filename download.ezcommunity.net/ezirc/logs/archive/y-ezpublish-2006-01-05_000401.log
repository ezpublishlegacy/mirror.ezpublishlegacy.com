[01-03-2006 06:03:59] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> im not sure what you are asking,...
[01-03-2006 06:05:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i want to know if there are already to the soap-service registable function that are already been implemented.
[01-03-2006 06:05:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but as i guess, that otherwise i have to implement them by myself.
[01-03-2006 06:09:52] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> what functions would that be? people usually have very different services which they want to use...
