[04-29-2005 08:38:33] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> i want to fetch only visible nodes using content/list while logged as admin
[04-29-2005 08:38:53] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> can't find a way
[04-29-2005 08:41:37] [#ezpublish] <xbit> if you only want to fetch visible nodes while logged in as admin, then how will you change visible/hidden status?
[04-29-2005 08:42:13] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i think it's best to fetch everything when using the admin-interface
[04-29-2005 09:03:10] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> i need to get amount of visible nodes
