[01-09-2006 10:09:19] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hey
[01-09-2006 10:09:55] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> I need help concerning related object fetching
[01-09-2006 10:10:47] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> I would like to have the same behavior as in the admin interface where we can edit object relation ... in extenso I want to distinguish images and objects

[01-09-2006 10:11:22] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> I looked at the code of edit_relation.tpl but couldn't understand it cause it seems to use some specific variables
[01-09-2006 10:11:35] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> like $grouped_related ...

[01-09-2006 10:19:50] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> a simpler question: how do you declare a new array in a template ?
[01-09-2006 10:20:11] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> {set $newarray=array()} ?
[01-09-2006 10:20:52] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> {def $newarray = array()}
[01-09-2006 10:21:06] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> you can use set only when it has been def'ed
[01-09-2006 10:21:44] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> about the first question ... can you explain better please?
[01-09-2006 10:21:46] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> ok thanks ...
[01-09-2006 10:22:01] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> I have a product class
[01-09-2006 10:22:10] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> I can associate images and other product to a product

[01-09-2006 10:23:53] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> but I want to display a div solely if the related_contentobject_array contains related "product" and not if it contains only images ... not sure I'm clear
[01-09-2006 10:23:59] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> this is the case in the admin interface
[01-09-2006 10:24:16] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> where the edit_relation.tpl do the distinction between files, images and objects
[01-09-2006 10:24:24] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> and I was wondering if it was possible to do the same
[01-09-2006 10:25:16] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> but i found out that this was managed in kernel/content/relationedit.php

[01-09-2006 10:27:07] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> So now this is how I do. I declare a new array for related images (i need them too), and another one for related products... I am going through $node.object.related_contentobject_array and bases on the class of the related object i append it to the corresponding array I can use later in my template
[01-09-2006 10:27:10] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> clearer ?
[01-09-2006 10:28:31] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> if not this is due to my poor english level sorry ;)
[01-09-2006 10:30:10] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> hum ... indeed, how can I append objects to an array in templates ... using $arrayname|append($object) will display Array
[01-09-2006 10:30:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes, I think that is the way you can do it
[01-09-2006 10:31:10] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> {set $alreadyexistingarray = $alreadyexistingarray|append($yourobject)}
[01-09-2006 10:31:45] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> oh ... ok
[01-09-2006 10:31:48] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> thanks sir

[01-09-2006 10:34:21] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> last question (i hope) ... how do i know the size of my generated array ? $myarray.count ?
[01-09-2006 10:34:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> oh, I will not spoil the fun for you :)
[01-09-2006 10:34:30] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> $myarray|count
[01-09-2006 10:35:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> . operator is for exploring data structures, pipe operator is a notation to pass params to tpl operators
[01-09-2006 10:37:16] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> sorry my question was really ridiculous ... I am a bit sick today ;)
[01-09-2006 10:37:53] [#ezpublish] <nottavi> ok I now see what ravens are ... but don't really understand what you meant with dead ravens ... but ...
