[01-27-2006 06:08:42] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ezpublish 3.6 isn't compatible with PHP 5 ?
[01-27-2006 06:09:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no version is
[01-27-2006 06:09:28] [#ezpublish] <zrg> afaik
[01-27-2006 06:09:47] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ! :'(
[01-27-2006 06:10:02] [#ezpublish] <zrg> 3.6 for php 4.3, 3.7 for php 4.4
[01-27-2006 06:10:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> whats the problem
[01-27-2006 06:10:33] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> my host provide only php 5
[01-27-2006 06:10:43] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you got shitty host :)
[01-27-2006 06:14:03] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> :'(
[01-27-2006 06:15:08] [#ezpublish] <zrg> do you know about what i asked earlier?
[01-27-2006 06:15:39] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> zrg: i never used shop feature in ezpublish, sorry
[01-27-2006 06:21:45] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> trying ezp 3.7 with php 4.2 is useless ?
[01-27-2006 06:23:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i'd think so
[01-27-2006 06:23:38] [#ezpublish] <zrg> 3.6 is the same tho
[01-27-2006 06:25:26] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i understand differencies between php 4 / php 5. But i don't with php 4.2 / 4.3 / 4.4 ...
[01-27-2006 06:25:34] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> since its a minor version change
[01-27-2006 06:32:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> theoretically
[01-27-2006 06:32:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> the fact is, in anything big enough, like ez, nyances from minor changes pop up
[01-27-2006 06:33:35] [#ezpublish] <zrg> if you start from new install i recommend php 4.4 and ez 3.7
[01-27-2006 06:37:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> agreed
[01-27-2006 06:39:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> for me its not a ezpublish problem
[01-27-2006 06:40:01] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> its a PHP problem
[01-27-2006 06:40:21] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> php have to be compatible between minor revision

[01-27-2006 06:52:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it can be trouble when your web app (eZ publish 3.x) is very, very tightly coupled (like per ez release) to a specific php release (possibly point release). With great power comes great responsiblity

[01-27-2006 07:06:47] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i have a ezpublish 3.7 and i want to migrate into ezpublish 3.6

[01-27-2006 07:07:45] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i have modified article class, add one class
[01-27-2006 07:07:50] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> that the only things
[01-27-2006 07:07:56] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> others are only folder & article
[01-27-2006 07:08:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i recommend install 3.6 from scratch, then add content through using package
[01-27-2006 07:08:27] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> package ?
[01-27-2006 07:08:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you can make package of content, look under Setup

[01-27-2006 07:12:01] [#ezpublish] <_thomas> but 3.6. -> 3.7 is only the reference bug thing

[01-27-2006 07:12:21] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> if i can do cp -r settings/ target/settings and same for templates, its ok for me
