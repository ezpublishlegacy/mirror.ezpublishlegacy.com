[04-27-2006 06:23:45] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> having a big big big problem with my eZ installation ... server load has always been load and since a week or so it has been skyrocketing!
[04-27-2006 06:23:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> always been low, sorry
[04-27-2006 06:24:16] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> around 0.7 ... now I am lucky if I get a 7 ... with average of 25
[04-27-2006 06:24:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> any idea on how to debug this?
[04-27-2006 06:25:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> I cannot understand if it could be a db inconsistency issue, or something else ...

[04-27-2006 09:49:28] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> like 3 ?
[04-27-2006 09:50:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> ah, to answer that I should actually enable the debug but I fear doing so now in this condition :)
[04-27-2006 09:50:14] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> debug by ip

[04-27-2006 09:50:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> I'll try it now and may the pagan gods protect me
[04-27-2006 09:50:29] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> yes , ok, but it's overhead nonetheless
[04-27-2006 09:50:35] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ok

[04-27-2006 09:59:39] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> indeed it is too much, but the homepage is not simple
