[12-07-2005 03:13:56] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> hi all
[12-07-2005 03:50:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hi rappy
[12-07-2005 04:07:26] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> some 87 year old fart here in norway is going to pay 100 000 dollars for marrying a 18-year old... very nice...
[12-07-2005 04:12:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[12-07-2005 04:12:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> he's gonna get laid and die :)
[12-07-2005 04:19:03] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> think about the poor girl.. her mother gets all the money, and she has to be with that old guy... poor her...
[12-07-2005 04:21:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> err why does the mother get the money ?? the girl's 18 yo right ?
[12-07-2005 04:22:03] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no.. she is 17 now...
[12-07-2005 04:22:15] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> he marries her when she is 18, is the agreement...
[12-07-2005 04:22:24] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i dont really get how that is allowed...
[12-07-2005 04:22:36] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> (allowed=legal)
[12-07-2005 04:25:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep...
[12-07-2005 04:40:08] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> according to the newspapers it is
[12-07-2005 04:40:45] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> he's not buying her, its tradition in the country where the mothers comes from or something
[12-07-2005 04:40:49] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> anyway.. it is disgusting
[12-07-2005 04:46:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah...
[12-07-2005 04:49:35] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> sounds much like the tradition to get drunk on christmas eve, and hit your wife...

[12-07-2005 09:24:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> nooow, if only i understood how contentview actually works
[12-07-2005 09:27:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hum ... reading about those eZ components ... so I presume there will be no 4.x versions for them ?
[12-07-2005 09:27:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> thats what i understood yes
[12-07-2005 09:27:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> which kinda sucks
[12-07-2005 09:30:24] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> Sulfur: well, it would kinda defeat the purpose of the components...
[12-07-2005 09:31:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> it kinda lowers their utility not being able to use them with current ezpublish
[12-07-2005 09:31:31] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> _Katana`: I take no objections from guys whose nickname starts with a lowly underscore!

[12-07-2005 09:31:48] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well
[12-07-2005 09:31:49] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> :)
[12-07-2005 09:32:10] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> well, you are right, they should write it for PHP4 in order to migrate ezp to PHP5
[12-07-2005 09:32:13] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> makes perfect sense
[12-07-2005 09:32:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh cool http://ez.no/content/new works again
[12-07-2005 09:32:44] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I can tell that they make heavy use of autoload capabilities so I can understand why php5 ... but I can't see why a 4.x version cannot be made or would void its philosophy
[12-07-2005 09:33:09] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> Sulfur: because it heavily relies on PHP 5 OO features ?
[12-07-2005 09:33:19] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> iterators, interfaces, visibility, etc ?
[12-07-2005 09:33:21] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> exceptions ...
[12-07-2005 09:33:34] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> the components are the first step toward eZ Publish for PHP 5...
[12-07-2005 09:33:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hevily relies does not make it impossible to be made .... I am thinking that in my production environment we have many applications which cannot simply be moved into php5 yet
[12-07-2005 09:34:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> (said that, I think I'll be loving php5)

[12-07-2005 09:54:25] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> buz:  can't you solve it with an operator ? I am not sure I understood your need , but it seems you need a statement which will output "something" wherever you put it into a tpl
[12-07-2005 09:54:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> nono
[12-07-2005 09:54:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> i need the output of the content view, but NOT pagelayout around it
[12-07-2005 09:56:12] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> buz: can't you just use "node_view_gui" from a module-template ?
[12-07-2005 09:56:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh do i get access checking then?
[12-07-2005 09:56:40] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok .... I am thinking of custom operators like randomnum which just cough out the desired number ...
[12-07-2005 09:56:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> but that warrants further checking
[12-07-2005 09:56:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> buz: well yes you get access checking with node_view_gui

[12-07-2005 10:17:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep exactly
[12-07-2005 10:18:02] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> mm
[12-07-2005 10:18:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but {1} would probably match both

[12-07-2005 10:18:15] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> really?
[12-07-2005 10:18:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and rewrite /nicename/1/2 to /myext/myview/1/2

I got it right ? :-?
[12-07-2005 10:21:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the exemple should be self explanatory...
[12-07-2005 10:21:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's the 3rd one
[12-07-2005 10:21:22] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes
[12-07-2005 10:21:26] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the 3rd one ok

[12-07-2005 10:22:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> oh well I'll try putting the /nicename/* on the left and the old one /myext/myview/{1} on right regardless of the labels

[12-07-2005 10:30:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it would just change the language of template translations
[12-07-2005 10:30:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> there are 2 locales
[12-07-2005 10:30:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> (raises 2 eyebrows)
[12-07-2005 10:30:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> Locale is for the i18n operator, it just applies to template texts
[12-07-2005 10:30:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> basically
[12-07-2005 10:30:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ContentObjectLocale determines the language you want your content objects in
[12-07-2005 10:30:43] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I have half a dozen eyebrows raised while pondering this
[12-07-2005 10:30:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok
[12-07-2005 10:31:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but ..
[12-07-2005 10:31:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[12-07-2005 10:31:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i would pay for a pic :)
[12-07-2005 10:31:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> so
[12-07-2005 10:31:22] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> isn't the list of avaliable languages (for site accesses too) displayed in admin?
[12-07-2005 10:31:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it means you could add a siteaccess with admin text displayed in english and content objects still in italian
[12-07-2005 10:31:38] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes yes this is ok
[12-07-2005 10:31:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it just lets you configure the language you can create the content objects in
[12-07-2005 10:31:51] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but isn't the list of languages available ?
[12-07-2005 10:31:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> err
[12-07-2005 10:31:57] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I mean
[12-07-2005 10:32:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> * raises eyebrows... *
[12-07-2005 10:32:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> aren't all available languages for admin siteaccess (not content) available in admin config section ?
[12-07-2005 10:32:43] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I haven't looked at it thoroughly
[12-07-2005 10:32:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hummm...
[12-07-2005 10:32:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> where exactly ?
[12-07-2005 10:33:03] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but I think that as anyone can switch their own language ... they would be listed
[12-07-2005 10:33:12] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> wait a sec I'll try to find it
[12-07-2005 10:33:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i don't think that's it :)
[12-07-2005 10:35:38] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hum ... I seem I was under mezcaline
[12-07-2005 10:35:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> setup => translations
[12-07-2005 10:36:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lets you setup what languages the content objects can be translated to
[12-07-2005 10:36:05] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well, then that'ssettled. I will make my siteaccess
[12-07-2005 10:36:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes yes
[12-07-2005 10:36:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> was wrong
