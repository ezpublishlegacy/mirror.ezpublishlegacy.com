[12-26-2005 18:49:52] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have only used $this = NULL;
[12-26-2005 18:50:32] [#ezpublish] <zrg> but essentially why not, you could use external function to instantiate object i guess.. ?

[12-26-2005 18:51:56] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> nm, will look at 3.7.2
[12-26-2005 18:52:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you have correct php/ez versions?
[12-26-2005 18:53:16] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> downloading latest stable ez now
[12-26-2005 18:53:34] [#ezpublish] <zrg> and have php 4.4 ?
[12-26-2005 18:53:47] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> 5.1.2
[12-26-2005 18:53:56] [#ezpublish] <zrg> php5 wont work
[12-26-2005 18:54:11] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> wont work???
[12-26-2005 18:54:20] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> why not?
[12-26-2005 18:54:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> because ez is made for php4 i think ;)
[12-26-2005 18:55:01] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> 5.* should be bc
[12-26-2005 18:55:56] [#ezpublish] <zrg> http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/info/requirements_for_ez_publish
[12-26-2005 18:56:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> nothing ever is, really, anyhow its specificly said, php4 only
[12-26-2005 18:57:22] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ez 3.7 series is for php 4.4, ez 3.6 and lower is for 4.3 and lower
[12-26-2005 18:58:10] [#ezpublish] <zrg> latest 3.6 and 3.7 should be nearly identical otherwise
[12-26-2005 18:59:04] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> Z publish does not work with PHP 5
[12-26-2005 18:59:04] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> gosh
[12-26-2005 18:59:31] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> this is nasty
[12-26-2005 18:59:32] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it is designed for php4
[12-26-2005 18:59:43] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> indeed
[12-26-2005 18:59:54] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> no pdo, no sqlite, no exceptions
[12-26-2005 19:00:15] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it is no fault of ez, obviously php5 is not completely backwards compatible, which is how it should be
[12-26-2005 19:00:42] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> I dont see why it does not work though
[12-26-2005 19:00:44] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you can easily install 4 and 5 in parallel i guess
[12-26-2005 19:01:22] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have not looked up why not, there must be good reason tho
[12-26-2005 19:01:41] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> and php6 is in devel
[12-26-2005 19:02:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> sigh
