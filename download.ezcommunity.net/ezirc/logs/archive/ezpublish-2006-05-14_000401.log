[05-13-2006 07:00:57] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> what did you do ?
[05-13-2006 07:01:19] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> I've copied the folders in site access.
[05-13-2006 07:01:26] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> plain -> mydesign
[05-13-2006 07:01:40] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> okey

[05-13-2006 07:01:49] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i guess you have some reading to do
[05-13-2006 07:01:52] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hehe
[05-13-2006 07:02:16] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> I'm reading all the time...
[05-13-2006 07:02:35] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> ok, I've edited the ini's in the copied folders

[05-13-2006 07:03:41] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> yes i think so
[05-13-2006 07:03:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> i believe thats right, yes
[05-13-2006 07:04:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> did you clear all caches
[05-13-2006 07:04:07] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> k, the var settings I did too.

[05-13-2006 07:05:44] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> the vars, they're created automatically, as I've read.
[05-13-2006 07:06:01] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> well, of course I've created a new folder in ./design
[05-13-2006 07:06:49] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm there was some examples at ez.no from the old docs, but it's gone now
[05-13-2006 07:06:52] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> may ./design/mydesign filled with sth meaningfull? or should I just copy an old design=
[05-13-2006 07:07:17] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> called "Building an eZ publish site" ?
[05-13-2006 07:07:24] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> with chess mates?
[05-13-2006 07:07:31] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> yes
[05-13-2006 07:07:36] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> and i found it

[05-13-2006 07:07:43] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> It's like that what im trying.
[05-13-2006 07:07:50] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> heh
[05-13-2006 07:07:54] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> k
[05-13-2006 07:07:55] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> yep
[05-13-2006 07:08:14] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> and - it still doesn't work.
[05-13-2006 07:08:39] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> I've enabled debugging.
[05-13-2006 07:08:50] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> so it says:

[05-13-2006 07:14:03] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> still nothing...I'm confused.
[05-13-2006 07:14:41] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> maybe to confused after six hours.
[05-13-2006 07:15:31] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> does it matter if I write:
[05-13-2006 07:15:38] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> http://localhost/index.php/mydesign
[05-13-2006 07:15:40] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> or

[05-13-2006 07:16:08] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> with default settings it should not, should it?
[05-13-2006 07:17:30] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> have you edited the settings/override/site.ini.append.php ?
[05-13-2006 07:17:45] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> yes
[05-13-2006 07:18:15] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> the default .htaccess doesn't allow you using just the domain name, like http://test.com/
[05-13-2006 07:18:29] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> oh.
[05-13-2006 07:18:31] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> you have to write http://test.com/index.php
[05-13-2006 07:18:40] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> or you have to write http://test.com/index.php/mydesign
[05-13-2006 07:19:01] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> you can change the .htaccess though, by just uncomment a couple of lines
[05-13-2006 07:19:13] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> it's all explained in the .htaccess
[05-13-2006 07:19:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> only that on some servers, that will result in server errors
[05-13-2006 07:19:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> if you stumble accross that, just comment the lines, again
[05-13-2006 07:19:35] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> so, no result when using 'localhost'?
[05-13-2006 07:19:49] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> try localhost/index.php
[05-13-2006 07:19:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> should show the default page
[05-13-2006 07:20:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> (if directoryindex is setup correctly)
[05-13-2006 07:22:20] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> http://localhost/index.php   says me "Welcome to eZ publish"

[05-13-2006 07:23:04] [#ezpublish] <norbs999> http://localhost/index.php/mydesign  say "not allowed..." and a login mask.

[05-13-2006 08:21:45] [#ezpublish] <phretor> this is the relation attribute: http://img54.imageshack.us/img54/4562/picture45ek.png
[05-13-2006 08:22:23] [#ezpublish] <phretor> and this is the class http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/6255/picture61hf.png
[05-13-2006 08:22:46] [#ezpublish] <phretor> only one field is showing up after a click on"create new"
[05-13-2006 08:23:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's weird
[05-13-2006 08:23:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> cleared the cache and all that?
[05-13-2006 08:24:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> uuhm wait
[05-13-2006 08:24:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> xavier added new features it seems
[05-13-2006 08:25:14] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: lemme clean *all* the cache via command line
[05-13-2006 08:25:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> there is in fact a new template i dont know what it does
[05-13-2006 08:25:59] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: I still get that fatal error
[05-13-2006 08:26:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh xavier changed soemething
[05-13-2006 08:26:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> "The new related object is created upon the validation of the containing object, not when creating it"
[05-13-2006 08:26:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'll have to do some testing
[05-13-2006 08:26:33] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: can I disable that feature?
[05-13-2006 08:26:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> try a svn revision pre 1100
[05-13-2006 08:27:23] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: and what if I want a relation without the "Create now" feature?
[05-13-2006 08:27:32] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: and just one
[05-13-2006 08:27:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> click remove default placement node
[05-13-2006 08:28:03] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: by the way, AJAX could give a lot of help :)
[05-13-2006 08:28:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> i know
[05-13-2006 08:28:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> i just dont find the time

[05-13-2006 08:30:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> i didnt fix it
[05-13-2006 08:30:44] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: okie

[05-13-2006 08:39:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok the fact that you see only one line is somehow caused by a new template
[05-13-2006 08:41:00] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: of course, but using Javascript in that way doesn't seem so "safe", IMHO
[05-13-2006 08:41:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> he is using javascript?
[05-13-2006 08:41:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> lemme see
[05-13-2006 08:41:31] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm i miss that page in setup where you choose which "types" to handle (gallery, forum, blog etc.) how do i add a forum for instance afterwards - i never had to do this "manually" before :)
[05-13-2006 08:41:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah i cant figure out where that one did go to
[05-13-2006 08:41:53] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: to hide/reveal fields
[05-13-2006 08:41:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> you can export the forum stuff from an existing site and importit as package
[05-13-2006 08:42:10] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> k
[05-13-2006 08:43:32] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> ah okey - i found it :)

[05-13-2006 08:44:26] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[05-13-2006 08:44:57] [#ezpublish] <phretor> guys, shouldn't this http://rafb.net/paste/results/02ybae60.html fetch all children of type "Floated Image" (id: floated_image)?
[05-13-2006 08:45:09] [#ezpublish] <phretor> (and only those kind of objects)
[05-13-2006 08:45:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah that javascript is highly problematical
[05-13-2006 08:47:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont like those changes, at all
[05-13-2006 08:48:24] [#ezpublish] <phretor> fetch('content', 'list' does not properly fetch... :\
[05-13-2006 08:51:49] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> not 'content','list'  ,but just content,list i think
[05-13-2006 08:52:08] [#ezpublish] <phretor> nnn0: no

[05-13-2006 08:53:04] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i guess it doesn't matter

[05-13-2006 11:21:54] [#ezpublish] <phretor> someone alive?
[05-13-2006 11:22:29] [#ezpublish] <phretor> can you help me with that? it doesn't filter the fetched content, instead it fetches *all* children: http://rafb.net/paste/results/pkL9BA42.html why?
[05-13-2006 11:29:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> looks correct to me
[05-13-2006 11:29:48] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: it doesn't filter at all
[05-13-2006 11:30:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's because of
[05-13-2006 11:30:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> class_filter_type  	string  	The type of class filtering (include/exclude).  	No.
[05-13-2006 11:30:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> class_filter_array 	array 	The classes that should be filtered. 	No.
[05-13-2006 11:31:32] [#ezpublish] <phretor> No?
[05-13-2006 11:31:55] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: I need to fetch 'floated_image' objects only
[05-13-2006 11:32:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[05-13-2006 11:32:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> compare the lines above to your code ;)
