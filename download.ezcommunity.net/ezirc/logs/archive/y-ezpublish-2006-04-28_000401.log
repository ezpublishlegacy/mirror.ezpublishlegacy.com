[04-26-2006 04:24:42] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi there
[04-26-2006 04:25:15] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> in the last days I read here that the enhancedobjectrelation datatypes would allow to create new object as object relation
[04-26-2006 04:25:24] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> So i've installed the extension
[04-26-2006 04:26:29] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but when I set up the attribute, the type only give me the opportunity to "add" existing object only
[04-26-2006 04:27:52] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> can anybody tell me how I can correct this ?
[04-26-2006 04:30:45] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok forget my question please ... i made a mistake
