[05-15-2006 06:14:47] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hi all
[05-15-2006 06:15:09] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I have a small I just can't figure out right now
[05-15-2006 06:15:43] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> to make simple: I have a site with 2 siteaccesses (admin + site itself)
[05-15-2006 06:16:35] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I created a module for the site itself, but in order to let it be accessed by "anonymous", I need to activate the extension containing this module, in the admin siteaccess.
[05-15-2006 06:17:16] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> in my extension, I also extended the design and so on... BUT now in my admin siteaccess, ezp is trying to override the templates using the ones of the extension
[05-15-2006 06:18:08] [#ezpublish] <kore__> use override on siteaccess basis - if needed symlink them to several siteaccesses
[05-15-2006 06:18:54] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> you mean to place the override.ini settings in the settings/siteaccess/... dir ?
[05-15-2006 06:22:26] [#ezpublish] <kore__> yes
[05-15-2006 06:25:24] -!- DiGiTa|_ [n=pet2poul@84.4.42.31] has quit []
[05-15-2006 06:26:36] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> is there any other way to do that ?
[05-15-2006 06:26:57] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I mean, when I have to activate the extension for instance, it's the only way to do that job to give access to anon user?
[05-15-2006 06:35:18] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> B-KiLLer`: do you want to give everybody access to the module?
[05-15-2006 06:39:14] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yes
[05-15-2006 06:54:03] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> [RoleSettings]

[05-15-2006 06:54:38] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> in extension/yourext/settings/site.ini.append.php
[05-15-2006 06:54:58] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> then roles will not be checked for your module
[05-15-2006 06:59:47] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hmm yes, that could be an option
[05-15-2006 07:15:59] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> thanks

[05-15-2006 07:37:11] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> quick question
[05-15-2006 07:37:25] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I have a problem with clearing cache on a 3.7.2 ez version
[05-15-2006 07:37:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> it seems clearcache script doesn't empty the var/plain/cache directory ... Does anybody here could help me on that point ?
[05-15-2006 07:39:15] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> the VarDir is correctly defined in the [FileSettings] of my site.ini.append.php file
[05-15-2006 07:39:20] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> rights seems to be correct
[05-15-2006 07:45:10] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I think you can specify to the clearcache script which dir you want to empty
[05-15-2006 07:45:51] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> ./clearcache --var-subdir=plain
[05-15-2006 07:48:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok thanks
[05-15-2006 07:48:29] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> It seems better
[05-15-2006 07:48:59] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but on other site I have develop when I do --clear-all the plain subdir is cleaned ... but not in that case ...

[05-15-2006 08:34:33] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> is there a way to replace \n by a space
[05-15-2006 08:34:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> where
[05-15-2006 08:34:59] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> or remove them
[05-15-2006 08:35:32] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I am changing the meta tag description ... by doing {$node.object.data_map.short_description.content.xml_data|striptags}
[05-15-2006 08:35:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> dunno how that works in template
[05-15-2006 08:35:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> in php its quite straightforwad
[05-15-2006 08:36:05] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> how would you do in php ?
[05-15-2006 08:36:15] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> str_replace ?
[05-15-2006 08:37:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> sure

[05-15-2006 08:55:51] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> you could create your own template operator
[05-15-2006 08:56:22] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> if I'm not wrong ez can already use as template operator all the php functions which take only 1 argument... too bad for str_replace :)
[05-15-2006 08:56:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I think it is what I will do ...
[05-15-2006 08:56:47] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I just can't fnd the doc for creating custom template operator
[05-15-2006 08:57:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> kalooni: go to admin -> setup -> rad
