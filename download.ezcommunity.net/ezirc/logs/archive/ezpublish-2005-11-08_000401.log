[11-07-2005 22:34:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmmm, fun with payment gateways
[11-07-2005 22:34:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> makes me wonder
[11-07-2005 22:37:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> has anyone worked with a true payment gateway or are they all workflows :\
[11-07-2005 22:38:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> seems most of them redirect to a server instead of asking for the required user input and transmiting the input to the payment gateway service
[11-07-2005 22:39:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> like ezpaypal :/ ,
[11-07-2005 22:42:17] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i was thinking that one would create a master workflow which would get called by the before checkout trigger and based on an if statement check for a passed hidden variable to signify if it is to display user input form, process user input form, or execute / submit payment details to service an awaite for return code (error vs success) then continues to the next steps ... etc
