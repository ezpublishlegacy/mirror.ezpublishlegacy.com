[05-05-2006 03:27:51] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> hi
[05-05-2006 03:28:19] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i like when my ez sites look so fast : http://www.renovation-luberon.com/ :)
[05-05-2006 03:30:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> fast?
[05-05-2006 03:30:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's slow as hell
[05-05-2006 03:30:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> too many images to load individually
[05-05-2006 03:32:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm not so sure about the design, either
[05-05-2006 03:32:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> it looks like too many different styles cramped into one page?
[05-05-2006 03:33:42] [#ezpublish] <katana`> it's really fast once the images are cached by the browser buz
[05-05-2006 03:33:47] [#ezpublish] <katana`> don't be an asshole :))
[05-05-2006 03:33:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> well i had to wait 5s to see anything in konqueror
[05-05-2006 03:34:01] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> muhu
[05-05-2006 03:34:12] [#ezpublish] <katana`> it's kinda instant here once the first pages have been loaded
[05-05-2006 03:34:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah after that it's good
[05-05-2006 03:34:29] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> DiGiTa|_, master in the website indirect promotion :p
[05-05-2006 03:34:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> problem is probably that konqui doesnt display before he got the images
[05-05-2006 03:34:45] [#ezpublish] <katana`> hi B-KiLLer` ;)
[05-05-2006 03:34:49] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hi there
[05-05-2006 03:35:11] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> bleh konqueror :)
[05-05-2006 03:35:14] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> who use that :)
[05-05-2006 03:35:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> its like safari
[05-05-2006 03:35:21] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> except buz
[05-05-2006 03:35:28] [#ezpublish] <katana`> well, safari is...
[05-05-2006 03:35:42] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> safari is slow
[05-05-2006 03:35:43] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yup, I agree it's slow as hell... or maybe it's because of our ADSL line completely submerged with email sending with 5mb of attachments :-x
[05-05-2006 03:36:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's not the reason in MY case ;)
[05-05-2006 03:36:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> http gets preference over email here
[05-05-2006 03:36:08] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> :D
[05-05-2006 03:39:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> DiGiTa|_: is that drop down thing at the top left dhtml or something?
[05-05-2006 03:39:52] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yup
[05-05-2006 03:40:14] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> but it's shit no ?
[05-05-2006 03:40:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think i like it
[05-05-2006 03:40:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> doesnt work like one would expect
[05-05-2006 03:40:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> lol
[05-05-2006 03:41:04] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> buz, the man who doesn't like anything :p
[05-05-2006 03:41:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> no
[05-05-2006 03:41:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> just very few things ;)
[05-05-2006 03:41:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh gotta run
[05-05-2006 03:41:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> bbl
[05-05-2006 03:50:19] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> no, he just does not like what YOU make :)
[05-05-2006 03:52:43] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> why ?
[05-05-2006 03:52:47] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i'm not gay :)
[05-05-2006 03:54:02] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> huhu
[05-05-2006 04:21:55] [#ezpublish] <katana`> B-KiLLer`: they still send huge emails out ? :)
[05-05-2006 04:25:21] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yup
[05-05-2006 04:25:31] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> sometimes for business... but most of the time for fun :D
[05-05-2006 04:25:58] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> if you (by accident...) send a small video on the internal mailing list
[05-05-2006 04:26:17] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> you can be sure that 5 minutes later, access to the net is slow as hell :)
[05-05-2006 04:58:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> not true. i liked some designs by DiGiTa|_ very much
[05-05-2006 04:58:36] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ;)
[05-05-2006 04:58:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> just not the current one
[05-05-2006 04:58:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> (and i freely admit that i totally suck as designer)
[05-05-2006 04:58:49] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes i will change the background
[05-05-2006 04:59:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think there's too many different boxes
[05-05-2006 04:59:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> well it"s a site that talk about construction
[05-05-2006 04:59:57] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> so the different parts are like stone
[05-05-2006 05:00:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> aaaah
[05-05-2006 05:00:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's too high for me to figure out ;)
[05-05-2006 05:00:26] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :p
[05-05-2006 05:01:19] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it's my first site that doesn't use any ezp template
[05-05-2006 05:01:22] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :)
[05-05-2006 05:08:19] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> without css : http://www.renovation-luberon.com/chantiers_realises/(css)/false
[05-05-2006 05:20:10] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> DiGiTa|_: hooked on tableless design? ;)
[05-05-2006 05:21:06] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i only do tabeless design
[05-05-2006 05:21:12] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> table is for tabular data
[05-05-2006 05:21:17] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> not for layout
[05-05-2006 05:21:32] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> uhm.. what do you mean by not using ezp template exactly..
[05-05-2006 05:21:34] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> <-- confused
[05-05-2006 05:22:00] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ezp templates are sometimes too complicated
[05-05-2006 05:22:10] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> too many layers
[05-05-2006 05:24:27] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> uhm.. so by "doesn't use any ezp template" you mean "doesn't use {include uri"design:sometpl.tpl"}"?
[05-05-2006 05:25:09] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> or do you mean template overrides as well
[05-05-2006 05:25:26] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> well i mean basic templates
[05-05-2006 05:25:32] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> ie doing everything in pagelayout...
[05-05-2006 05:25:45] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> like pagelayout
[05-05-2006 05:25:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :)
[05-05-2006 05:26:13] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> pagelayout.tpl or header.tpl or footer.tpl or ezimage.tpl
[05-05-2006 05:26:25] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> ah..
[05-05-2006 05:26:53] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> blank pagelayout and all html/smarty in the override templates?
[05-05-2006 05:27:38] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> no i don't do a blank pagelayout
[05-05-2006 05:27:48] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> smarty ?
[05-05-2006 05:27:49] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> lol
[05-05-2006 05:28:16] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> well .. "smarty" then
[05-05-2006 05:28:34] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> -ish
[05-05-2006 05:31:00] -!- _rappy_ is now known as _Rappy_
[05-05-2006 05:31:51] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> it's pretty close to smarty
[05-05-2006 05:32:00] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes a little
[05-05-2006 05:42:22] -!- awormus [n=aaron@p54B12FD0.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has joined #ezpublish
[05-05-2006 05:47:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> probably much faster doing it this way?
[05-05-2006 05:47:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> (faster to run, not faster to build ;)
[05-05-2006 05:48:08] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes probably
[05-05-2006 05:48:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> did you compare page generation times?
[05-05-2006 05:48:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> no :)
[05-05-2006 05:48:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> that would be interesting
[05-05-2006 06:08:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> how can i assign product to categories in 3.8=
[05-05-2006 06:10:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> ah theres a new datatype for that
[05-05-2006 06:13:46] [#ezpublish] <katana`> :)
[05-05-2006 06:14:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> is there any doc for the new ezxml in 3.8?
[05-05-2006 06:28:59] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> do treemenu STILL depend on $module_result.path in 3.8?
[05-05-2006 06:46:27] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> omg
[05-05-2006 06:50:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> how would it otherwise work?
[05-05-2006 06:52:36] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> well.. would be nice if there was an equivalent to $module_result.path in the override templates
[05-05-2006 06:53:58] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> as it is now I can't use treemenu in i.e. folder_full.tpl
[05-05-2006 06:54:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think treemenu is very useful for normal things
[05-05-2006 06:54:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> at least i never figured out how it really works
[05-05-2006 06:54:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> the datastructure is kinda weird
[05-05-2006 06:55:08] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> it's quite nice in 3.7 http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_7/reference/template_operators/miscellaneous/treemenu
[05-05-2006 06:55:22] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> the first example...
[05-05-2006 06:55:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> well as long as you cant really code recursively in tempalte language its an ugly hack no matter what
[05-05-2006 06:56:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> (you can in fact code recursively it's just very very ugly)
[05-05-2006 06:56:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> as {include current_tpl_file} works recursively
[05-05-2006 07:00:20] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> is it possible to make variables in pagelayout global?
[05-05-2006 07:00:49] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> hmm.. no.. pagelayout is compiled after module result...
