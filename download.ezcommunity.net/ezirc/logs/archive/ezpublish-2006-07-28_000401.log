[07-27-2006 16:11:04] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> what's the best way to allow someone to enter formatted text (e.g. anything that the on-line editor allows such as bold or underline) and have it displayed?  The default seems to be to strip out all the extra formatting info and just display it as plain text, which seems a little odd to me...  What is the recommended way to pass this formatting out to the view?
[07-27-2006 16:23:16] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> even in an article xml block it converts it to plain text (and for some reason converts </strong> into </br>
[07-27-2006 16:23:47] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> er, actually it converts </strong> into <br />
[07-27-2006 16:28:48] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> ahhh, I just discovered the <br /> is from the ezxmltags/line.tpl...  that seems awfully strange...  why would they always tag that onto the end?
[07-27-2006 16:37:16] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> I'm looking in the database, and its storing it with the formatting tags intact (strong and empathasize), its strange that its stripping them out when its being viewed...
[07-27-2006 16:46:00] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> ahhh, this is a bug with the current version...  http://ez.no/bugs/view/8702  <whew> I was about to go mental...
[07-27-2006 17:03:59] [#ezpublish] <DodgerM1976> I swapped my main node (parent node, whatever you want to call it, the root node that is in place when you start the admin) with one of its children that I'd created.  The child and former parent both look right, but the "content structure" area has gone blank.  I've cleared the cache, and still nothing is in there...  is there some trick to get it to update and display the new strucutre?

[07-27-2006 23:28:14] [privmsg] <lilo> Hi....just a reminder. As of 11am GMT on Sunday, freenode will allow Tor access only via the hidden service. Please take a look at http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml and switch as soon as possible. It's easier than it sounds. Sorry for any repetition of this message. Thanks!
