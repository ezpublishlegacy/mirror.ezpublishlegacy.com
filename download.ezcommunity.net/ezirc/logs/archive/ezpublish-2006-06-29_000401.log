[06-28-2006 09:20:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> were you able to finally brew the beer, zrg ? ;)
[06-28-2006 09:22:09] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> hi awormus
[06-28-2006 09:22:25] [#ezpublish] <awormus> Sulfur__: don't know if we met in the conf... but I was there :)
[06-28-2006 09:22:52] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> I don't know awormus, I am massimiliano bariola from italy
[06-28-2006 09:24:26] [#ezpublish] <awormus> yeh, I think we talked once :)
[06-28-2006 09:24:56] [#ezpublish] <zrg> nobody wanted my beer :(
[06-28-2006 09:24:57] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> argh ... I just started today  a plain vanilla install of 3.8.1 on a dedicated server and I get total runtimes of 1 second but total script times of 14 seconds on backend and a terrible 21 secs runtime and 0.1 / 12 seconds on frontend. it never happened anything like that ... any ideas ?
[06-28-2006 09:25:31] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> I'd have tried it zrg
[06-28-2006 09:25:45] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> so you had to drink it all on your way back ? ;)
[06-28-2006 09:25:57] [#ezpublish] <zrg> im still in oslo :)
[06-28-2006 09:26:02] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> wow
[06-28-2006 09:26:26] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> so grab some eZ developer by the ear and ask them why the hell do I get those figures ;)
[06-28-2006 09:27:14] [#ezpublish] <zrg> drag them in here and we'll mob them :)
[06-28-2006 09:27:40] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> there ain't none here, it seems :)
[06-28-2006 09:28:13] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> hey, about Open Funding .... how much for a video of the eZ core developers singing silly drunken songs??? :)
[06-28-2006 09:29:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> nope, they definately are not here :P
[06-28-2006 09:34:20] [#ezpublish] <zrg> where did you film them?
[06-28-2006 09:34:57] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> leaving the bonfire to the pub, we did a stop and we amused ourselves by singing a little, it was great  time :)
[06-28-2006 09:35:04] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> and no, we weren't drunk yet ... :)

[06-28-2006 09:45:48] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> huh .. I don't know , I found myself adding and adding and adding to them ... it's nt simple stuff
[06-28-2006 09:45:51] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> not
[06-28-2006 09:46:54] [#ezpublish] <btd> like this one: http://ez.no/community/forum/developer/importing_update_entry_if_it_already_exists
[06-28-2006 09:47:02] [#ezpublish] <btd> seems to be an extention of the basic one
[06-28-2006 09:47:33] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> I don't think you'll find any basic script, last time I had need, I had to browse the forums and found tidbits here and there (not in contribs)
[06-28-2006 09:47:52] [#ezpublish] <btd> basically i need a cmd line script that will greate an object, and add it to a couple of places in the node tree.
[06-28-2006 09:48:34] [#ezpublish] <btd> and I'll be happy XD I can cruft together the surrounding stuff myself, and its about adding an article from a remote location maybe 2-3 times a day..
[06-28-2006 09:48:42] [#ezpublish] <btd> so effectivity is .. hmm.. not needed :)
[06-28-2006 09:49:24] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> I have something like that but it's lousy coding - done in a hurry and patched on the go , I don't even remember where do I have to touch to configure it :)
[06-28-2006 09:49:40] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> however if you badly need it, I could dig it out and send it to you on friday
[06-28-2006 09:49:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> assuming that you didn't find anything better by that time ;)
[06-28-2006 09:50:01] [#ezpublish] <btd> I thank you for the offer, but thats like a day to late.. I really nbeed this by tomorrow..
[06-28-2006 09:50:24] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> hmm .... sorry, then I can't help you too much ... leaving in an hour and tomorrow not coming ..
[06-28-2006 09:50:25] [#ezpublish] <btd> sometime ago I made a script that forces stuff directly into the eZ database, it works well enough, but is a tad brittle
