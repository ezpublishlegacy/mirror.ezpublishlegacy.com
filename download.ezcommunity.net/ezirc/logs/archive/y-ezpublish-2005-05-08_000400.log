[05-06-2005 02:44:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hey guys, per my recent breakdowns (both in code and time) i've gone ahead and automated the ezlog archive of each days current irc log via cron
[05-06-2005 02:44:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> this means even when i'm doa or mia the day's irc logs won't be lost because of a badly written phpircbot :)
[05-06-2005 02:44:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> dated logs are available to the public at : http://download.ezpublishhosting.com/ezirc/logs/
