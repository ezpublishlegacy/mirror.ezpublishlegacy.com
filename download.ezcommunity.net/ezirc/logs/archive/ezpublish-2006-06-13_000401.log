[06-12-2006 07:15:37] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> hi
[06-12-2006 07:15:50] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> {node_view_gui view=banner content_node=$banner}
[06-12-2006 07:16:59] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> is possible t emulte this defining a FUNCTION or something similar, inside a template? i don like too much to redefine the view inside settings, i woul prefer to define a templae and call it with the node like parameter
[06-12-2006 07:17:30] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> t emulte ?
[06-12-2006 07:17:34] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> to amulate ?
[06-12-2006 07:17:37] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> emulate
[06-12-2006 07:17:39] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> emulate, sorry
[06-12-2006 07:17:44] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ok
[06-12-2006 07:17:58] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> do you understand what i mean?
[06-12-2006 07:18:02] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> no :)
[06-12-2006 07:18:22] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> hehe, sorry, i dont speak english well
[06-12-2006 07:18:37] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i want something like...
[06-12-2006 07:19:17] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> define a file hello.tpl and from another tpl to call hello.tpl with a node like parameter
[06-12-2006 07:19:34] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah>  {node_view_gui view=banner content_node=$banner}
[06-12-2006 07:19:39] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> this is similar
[06-12-2006 07:19:54] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> node like parameter ?
[06-12-2006 07:20:13] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> I don't get it
[06-12-2006 07:20:39] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> mmmm, like a parameter of a function
[06-12-2006 07:20:56] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> {hello.tpl content_node=$banner}
[06-12-2006 07:21:22] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> and inside hello.tpl i use content_node
[06-12-2006 07:21:28] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yeah oik
[06-12-2006 07:21:41] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> its possible?
[06-12-2006 07:21:52] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it's very basic
[06-12-2006 07:21:57] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> yes?
[06-12-2006 07:22:00] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> of course
[06-12-2006 07:22:22] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> how?
[06-12-2006 07:22:26] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> create a hello.tpl template into your templates dir
[06-12-2006 07:22:30] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> yes
[06-12-2006 07:22:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> and then you will be able to ask for this view
[06-12-2006 07:23:18] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> but how?
[06-12-2006 07:23:27] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i dont want {node_view_gui view=banner content_node=$banner}
[06-12-2006 07:23:40] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> why ?
[06-12-2006 07:24:27] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> because this form to do it, i dont like, it fuzzy my work inside settings, i prefer to define a tpl and call it directly, not touching the setting
[06-12-2006 07:24:50] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> like a datatype
[06-12-2006 07:25:16] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i know EZP its to work touching the settying, asociating views to class types, but i ask oif i culd call a tpl with parameters
[06-12-2006 07:25:40] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes, with include
[06-12-2006 07:25:52] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> but include inside a foreach ?
[06-12-2006 07:25:58] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> what about that?
[06-12-2006 07:26:17] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> never tested
[06-12-2006 07:26:22] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> try :)
[06-12-2006 07:26:26] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> {include uri='path_to_file' [ name='namespace' ] [ parameter(s)='value(s)'  ]}
[06-12-2006 07:26:37] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> could work
[06-12-2006 07:26:44] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i know include but i thought i cant call it inisde a foreach
[06-12-2006 07:26:56] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i will try
[06-12-2006 07:27:24] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i think it's not a prolem
[06-12-2006 07:27:40] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> good news, i hate settings
[06-12-2006 07:27:49] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> lol
[06-12-2006 07:28:00] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> lazy guy
[06-12-2006 07:28:33] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> yes, i have bad memory and in two or tree days i will forgot i do in settings
[06-12-2006 07:29:34] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i prefer all in code, i like EZP all the way, i know tpl in EZP break MVC because they are too strong, but i lke that
[06-12-2006 07:30:50] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> thx digital, i will continue trying to learn EZP when i finish a page i will show you
[06-12-2006 07:30:51] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> bye

[06-12-2006 17:14:52] [#ezpublish] <SunRayCafe> doesn't seem to be consistent with filesize, type, or area uploading to. However, once it has failed on a file, it will always fail on that file. Even if we create a new object to try and upload it to
[06-12-2006 17:15:40] [#ezpublish] <SunRayCafe> specific file type in all cases I know of is PDF. I've extended timeout from 30 to 60 seconds, to 350 seconds. Doesn't help.
