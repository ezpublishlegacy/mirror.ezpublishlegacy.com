[03-16-2006 07:10:25] [#ezpublish] <phretor> is there any way to limit the type of the objects that can be instantiated within a certain folder?
[03-16-2006 07:13:18] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> in the roles, content->crate->[clas 1, class 2, ... ]
[03-16-2006 07:41:41] [#ezpublish] <phretor> how could I fetch nodes by mean of arbitrary attributes' value?
[03-16-2006 07:41:58] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I mean, the node_id is not known a-priori
[03-16-2006 07:44:35] [#ezpublish] <phretor> being more precise, I'd like to fetch all objects (of a certain type/class) whose relations are pointing to the current node
[03-16-2006 07:48:39] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> have not done such a fetch im afraid
[03-16-2006 07:51:06] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: I found that the reverse_relation attribute is what I was looking for ;-)
[03-16-2006 07:51:45] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> sounds right indeed, will you be fetching from your hole node-tree?
[03-16-2006 07:52:40] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> .. since that relation could be found from wherever
[03-16-2006 08:00:55] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: node_view_gui should use the line view template/override, isn't it?
[03-16-2006 08:04:03] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> depends. it´s up too you realy.
[03-16-2006 08:04:03] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> node_view_gui view=line ... uses default line view i thing
[03-16-2006 08:04:57] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> then you can override that line.tpl for whatever classes and such, or even write your own view...
[03-16-2006 08:05:05] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> node_view_gui view=line_my_line_view
[03-16-2006 08:05:19] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: right
[03-16-2006 08:05:40] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: but if line has been overridden, view=line should use the override
[03-16-2006 08:11:12] [#ezpublish] <phretor> eZ has somethime non-deterministic behavior :-)
[03-16-2006 08:12:40] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> yes, if it is a general override with no limitations like override for speciffic node, class et.c.
[03-16-2006 08:13:29] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> if no changes apear, always clear cache
[03-16-2006 08:13:51] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> or even better, disable cache during development
[03-16-2006 08:14:04] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: how could I perform it?
[03-16-2006 08:14:20] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> disable cache?
[03-16-2006 08:16:38] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> in setup tab -> ini settings -> site.ini, disable ViewCaching under ContentSettings and TemplateCache under TemplateSettings
[03-16-2006 08:17:37] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> also enable DebugOutput under DebugSettings in the very same site.ini
[03-16-2006 08:19:03] [#ezpublish] * phretor gives a beer to bOkO_ 
[03-16-2006 08:19:38] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> n.p. :)
[03-16-2006 08:37:13] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: very strange {node_view_gui view=line content_node=$mynode} is not working :-\ - my override is not used

[03-16-2006 08:39:03] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> what does your section about that override look like in settings/siteacces/your_siteaccess/override.ini ?
[03-16-2006 08:40:58] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: it's strange because project_line.tpl (which overrides line.tpl) is applied well in other line views
[03-16-2006 08:41:37] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> you want to override for a speciffic type of class maybe?
[03-16-2006 08:41:59] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: it's already done - the override is not the problem
[03-16-2006 08:42:59] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: the problem is that the override works in normal line view but not when the node is fetched thru {foreach $node.object.reverse_related_contentobject_array as $project} and then passed to {node_view_gui content_node=$project}
[03-16-2006 08:43:09] [#ezpublish] <phretor> maybe the $project is not a node but an object
[03-16-2006 08:43:12] [#ezpublish] <phretor> lemme check
[03-16-2006 08:45:10] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> yes, its relevant what you give to node_view_gui
[03-16-2006 08:46:02] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: strange, $project has not a node_id => not a nod?
[03-16-2006 08:46:03] [#ezpublish] <phretor> e?
[03-16-2006 08:50:52] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> what is in $project ?
[03-16-2006 08:53:02] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I found that I should use $project.main_node instead of $project ;-)
[03-16-2006 08:53:42] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> my line of thaught is: loop through $node.object.reverse_related_contentobject_array, as you already do, to get hold of node_id:s, the fetch these nodes and then sent to node_view_gui
[03-16-2006 08:54:11] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> that last sounds good
[03-16-2006 08:54:22] [#ezpublish] <phretor> main_node does the fetch for you: {node_view_gui view=line content_node=$project} does not work, but $project.main_node works well.
[03-16-2006 08:54:35] [#ezpublish] <phretor> since $project is an object but $project.main_node is a node ;-)
[03-16-2006 08:54:38] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> aight then

[03-16-2006 09:06:25] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: have you tried "Object relation browse" extension=
[03-16-2006 09:06:26] [#ezpublish] <phretor> ?
[03-16-2006 09:07:28] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> dont think so, note sure what u mean
[03-16-2006 09:07:55] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> i have browsed for relations, but..
[03-16-2006 09:08:17] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> extension?
[03-16-2006 09:08:39] [#ezpublish] <phretor> there is an extension that helps you adding relations in a more user friendly way
[03-16-2006 09:08:54] [#ezpublish] <phretor> try it, it's on contributions/hacks
[03-16-2006 09:09:05] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> ahh, i see. nice
[03-16-2006 09:28:37] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: have you found something better?
[03-16-2006 09:28:38] [#ezpublish] <phretor> :-)
[03-16-2006 09:30:37] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> no, havent been in need for that so far
[03-16-2006 09:33:06] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: I'm experiencing a bad "Fatal error: eZ publish did not finish its request". How prevent those errors?
[03-16-2006 09:33:57] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> oh, impossible for me to say :) you need to get your hand dirty im afraid

[03-16-2006 09:37:22] [#ezpublish] <phretor> bOkO_: I'd like PHP's array_push() :-)
[03-16-2006 09:38:03] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> i dont think "def" and "append()" belong in the same statement
[03-16-2006 09:38:25] [#ezpublish] <phretor> ok but, where to store the result of $arr|append() ?
[03-16-2006 09:38:27] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> that would have to be
