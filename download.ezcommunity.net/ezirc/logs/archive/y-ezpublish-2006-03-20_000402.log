[03-19-2006 07:29:18] [#ezpublish] <zrg> lo folks
[03-19-2006 07:31:06] [#ezpublish] <xbit> good morning
[03-19-2006 08:07:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> morning?
[03-19-2006 08:07:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> i've been up for 36h now ;)
[03-19-2006 08:08:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> somehow lost track of what time of the day it's supposed to be ;)
[03-19-2006 08:11:16] [#ezpublish] <xbit> 36h ? wow...it's been ages since i could do that :/
[03-19-2006 08:11:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> well i had a few minutes of sleep here and there in the airplane
[03-19-2006 08:11:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> but i really cant sleep sitting in economy seats ;)
[03-19-2006 08:19:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> not sleepy enough that means
[03-19-2006 08:19:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> not necessarily
[03-19-2006 08:19:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> i sometimes managed sleeping at school for one ;)
[03-19-2006 08:19:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's just a bad environment ;)
[03-19-2006 08:20:10] [#ezpublish] <xbit> yep :)
[03-19-2006 08:20:28] [#ezpublish] <xbit> when you're drunk enough you can sleep anywhere, pretty neat ;)
[03-19-2006 08:20:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> you cant get THAT drunk on a plane if your gf sits next to you
[03-19-2006 08:20:53] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have played MUD briefly so i know about sleeping
[03-19-2006 08:21:39] [#ezpublish] <zrg> oh, thats another thing. poor buz :)
[03-19-2006 08:22:01] [#ezpublish] <xbit> hehe
