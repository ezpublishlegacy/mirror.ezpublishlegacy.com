[03-08-2006 09:24:42] [#ezpublish] <polin8> hi everyone, is there a way to create a template operator that doesn't require input or arguments?
[03-08-2006 09:24:53] [#ezpublish] <polin8> or do I need to use a template function for that?
[03-08-2006 09:30:28] [#ezpublish] <zrg> there are plenty operators with no arguments, no?
[03-08-2006 09:30:44] [#ezpublish] <zrg> or at least with optional arguments
[03-08-2006 09:32:43] [#ezpublish] <polin8> zrg: those all seem to work on an input value {"input"|foo} or there are some that work on arguments only {int("1")}, but none that seem to work without either, {bar}
[03-08-2006 09:33:06] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> polin8: yes its possible
[03-08-2006 09:33:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> like true()
[03-08-2006 09:33:16] [#ezpublish] <polin8> when I call a new operator that way I get an operator undefined error
[03-08-2006 09:33:29] [#ezpublish] <polin8> kris10an: thanks, that's a good one
[03-08-2006 09:33:34] [#ezpublish] <polin8> I'll look for that
[03-08-2006 09:35:17] [#ezpublish] <polin8> looks like it might be the 'input' => false key in the operatorTemplateHints method, thanks
[03-08-2006 09:36:32] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> polin8: if you have a simple template operator you should not need operatorTemplateHints...
[03-08-2006 09:36:55] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> go to the admin interface: Setup->RAD->TemplateOperator Wizard
[03-08-2006 09:39:13] [#ezpublish] <polin8> kris10an: thanks, I see the "Take's input option" now.  I must have an error somewhere else
