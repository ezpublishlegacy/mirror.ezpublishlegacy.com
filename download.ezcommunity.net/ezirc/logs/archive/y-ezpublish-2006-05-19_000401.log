[05-17-2006 06:41:15] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I'm working on a 3.7
[05-17-2006 06:41:27] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> is it possible to add a language
[05-17-2006 06:41:29] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ?

[05-17-2006 06:43:55] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I mean once a site exists is it possible to add another language to this site ?
[05-17-2006 06:44:45] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yes, hopefully :)
[05-17-2006 06:48:51] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> how ?
[05-17-2006 06:49:08] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> just modifying the site.ini ?
[05-17-2006 06:51:01] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> which version of eZ ?
[05-17-2006 06:51:24] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I think it has changed in 3.8, with the addition of a new array "SiteLanguage"
[05-17-2006 06:52:29] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> 3.7
[05-17-2006 06:52:35] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> 3.7.3
[05-17-2006 06:56:04] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> you can go directly in admin > setup > translations > add language
[05-17-2006 06:56:28] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok thanks, I didn't know that
[05-17-2006 06:56:45] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> but that doesn't work anymore in the ezp 3.8 :-/
