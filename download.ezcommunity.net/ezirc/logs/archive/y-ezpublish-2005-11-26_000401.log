[11-24-2005 10:03:49] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hi guys ....
[11-24-2005 10:04:35] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I am experiencing a problem (I pinpointed it) but I am unsure of whether it is incorrect assumptions on my part or an eZ bug.
[11-24-2005 10:04:55] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> anyone up for a quick consult ?
[11-24-2005 10:07:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ask
[11-24-2005 10:13:35] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> very briefly, I have this flow of operation: $db->eZDB::instance; some operations on eZ DB. using pear::DB to create a connection to a foreign DB. $surveyDB = DB::connect(mydsn); doing some work on this external, non-eZ database. script continues; then an eZ API call fails on an eZ DB query because it looks for eZ tables into the foreign db.
[11-24-2005 10:13:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> uuugh
[11-24-2005 10:13:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> not good
[11-24-2005 10:13:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah, i have done that
[11-24-2005 10:13:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> one of the main peering points in switzerland is flooded
[11-24-2005 10:14:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> PEAR::DB will use the existing connection or something
[11-24-2005 10:14:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> note that eZ db objs and my foreign DB objs are called differently
[11-24-2005 10:14:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well, ALL of them use the existing connection (I think PHP reuses them)
[11-24-2005 10:14:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we have met that issue, and we have fixed it
[11-24-2005 10:15:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah actually we were NOT using PEAR::DB
[11-24-2005 10:15:05] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> also almost all eZ DB-interacting methods do an eZDB::instance ... but this seems not to check whether the parameters of the connection have been changed
[11-24-2005 10:15:19] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes ADODB has same problem
[11-24-2005 10:15:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I think it's a PHP issue, but also an eZ wrong assumption
[11-24-2005 10:15:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> are the username / host / pass for connect similar ?
[11-24-2005 10:15:57] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hey are the same (I use same restricted user for both DBs)
[11-24-2005 10:16:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> because I know PHP will reuse a connection if one has already been established with the same connection infos, NOT including the DB name
[11-24-2005 10:16:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> since the DB is selected using _select_db
[11-24-2005 10:16:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> so yes, connect will return the existing connection, and mysql_select_db will switch
[11-24-2005 10:16:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> try adding a specific user for your application, it should fix the issue
[11-24-2005 10:16:49] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> so we agree with the cause; but the problem is : can it be considered a bug ?
[11-24-2005 10:16:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> fh[eZ], do I get partner points for what i say on IRC ? :)
[11-24-2005 10:16:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope it's PHP ...
[11-24-2005 10:17:04] [#ezpublish] * buz should get plenty of those then
[11-24-2005 10:17:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> are you a partner ? :
[11-24-2005 10:17:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ^^
[11-24-2005 10:17:22] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> we 're partnahs too
[11-24-2005 10:17:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> cool :)
[11-24-2005 10:20:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> anyway, I think an additional check into eZDB::instance wouldn't harm. being blissfully unaware of what happens outside the window isn't a good thing ;)
[11-24-2005 10:20:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well... think about what it would imply...
[11-24-2005 10:20:44] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you have to run a query to check what db you're connected to
[11-24-2005 10:20:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and what would you do ? warn the dev ?
[11-24-2005 10:21:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> there are situations where you can't do that for the developer, it should just be documented
[11-24-2005 10:25:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> no i'm not
[11-24-2005 10:25:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you're not what ? :)
[11-24-2005 10:25:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> partner
[11-24-2005 10:26:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> i should still get points though
[11-24-2005 10:26:10] [#ezpublish] * buz wants points *kiddiemode*
[11-24-2005 10:26:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[11-24-2005 10:26:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> okay :)
[11-24-2005 10:26:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> and not raven points
[11-24-2005 10:26:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> kristian is the one to blame for those
[11-24-2005 10:37:37] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> Katana`: isn't there a method to determine which db am I connected to ?
[11-24-2005 10:37:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> with a query i think
[11-24-2005 10:37:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and i'm not even sure
[11-24-2005 10:38:22] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> there is already an eZDB:: instance before all calls which need playing with db. I just want it to explicitly call every time a mysql_select_db
[11-24-2005 10:38:28] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> brute and effective
[11-24-2005 10:38:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> no query involved
[11-24-2005 10:39:42] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> that, or either prepend all queries in eZ with the explicit db name. of course this is lousy.
[11-24-2005 10:40:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, officially, mysql_select_db runs "USE dbname;"
[11-24-2005 10:40:30] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ..... the only other workaround is for ME to call the mysql_select_db before I enter the eZ API
[11-24-2005 10:40:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> damnit why won't you just change the username for the other DB ? :)
[11-24-2005 10:40:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no, THIS is the best workaround
[11-24-2005 10:40:53] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> because this project uses FIVE different DBs ?
[11-24-2005 10:40:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> requires you to change ONE line, and not hack the core and not add any resource usage
[11-24-2005 10:41:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> on THREE different servers??? :D
[11-24-2005 10:41:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> as long as they're on different servers it should not happen
[11-24-2005 10:41:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> if they're on the same server just create one username for each and your problem will be solved
[11-24-2005 10:41:43] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> in fact, the problem arose now on those 3 DBs wich are on the same server
[11-24-2005 10:41:51] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> arrrrrrrrh
[11-24-2005 10:41:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> there you are, usernames
[11-24-2005 10:42:04] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I hate dat
[11-24-2005 10:42:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> or db1.localhost, db2.localhost, db3.localhost as hostnames, will work as well
[11-24-2005 10:42:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but not that sure since they're all resolved ;)
[11-24-2005 11:12:34] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> then dinner is digested and it's back to work
[11-24-2005 11:12:51] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> we're swamped atm, so someone has to clock in some overtime
