[04-06-2006 14:48:05] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> somebody was talking about a javascript debugger-thingy extension for firefox earlier... anybody know?
[04-06-2006 14:48:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> firebug ?
[04-06-2006 14:48:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> maybe
[04-06-2006 14:48:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> or venkman
[04-06-2006 14:48:26] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> how does that work?
[04-06-2006 14:49:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> which is a full blown but somewhat weird debugger
[04-06-2006 14:49:35] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have used venkman
[04-06-2006 14:49:51] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> hmmm... firebug requires ff 1.5
[04-06-2006 14:50:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> so?
[04-06-2006 14:50:25] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> kubuntu only has 1.x in the packages
[04-06-2006 14:50:29] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you set breakpoints and stuff, usual debugger
[04-06-2006 14:50:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> kris10an: oh i know that problem
[04-06-2006 14:50:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> venkman is pretty old
[04-06-2006 14:50:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> aww :( source is eZ to install by hand
[04-06-2006 14:50:46] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> well.. can allways innstall the source..
[04-06-2006 14:50:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> you can get the tarball from mozilla org and use it in your homedir
[04-06-2006 14:50:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> no compiling required
[04-06-2006 14:51:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> that's what i did ;)
[04-06-2006 14:51:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[04-06-2006 14:51:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> or upgrade to dapper ;)
[04-06-2006 14:51:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> it works quite well
[04-06-2006 14:51:17] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> i did that before.. that workss perfectly..
[04-06-2006 14:51:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah it does ;)
[04-06-2006 14:51:33] [#ezpublish] <kracker> just don't switch back and forth you can hose your chrome / profile fairly simply :\
[04-06-2006 14:51:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> dapper is still a bit quirky though
[04-06-2006 14:51:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> (and ubuntu should be shot for their firefox upgrade policy)
[04-06-2006 14:52:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have been thinking to install dapper, see if installation works this time
[04-06-2006 14:52:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> i don't want quirky on my work machine..
[04-06-2006 14:52:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> i wouldnt place dapper on your work machine

[04-06-2006 14:53:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> couldnt figure out what it does anyhow
[04-06-2006 14:54:19] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> i like the fact that gam_server eats about 1 meg of ram every second...
[04-06-2006 14:54:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> wtf
[04-06-2006 14:54:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> it didnt do that to me
[04-06-2006 14:54:35] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> now i have a cronjob which runs "killall gam_server"
[04-06-2006 14:54:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> not on breezy and not on hoary either
[04-06-2006 14:54:50] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> i'm using breezy
[04-06-2006 14:54:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> it just occasionally chewed up a lot of cpu
[04-06-2006 14:55:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> sounds like something's broken really
[04-06-2006 14:55:28] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> i've seen the bugreport, and im not the only one with that problem..
[04-06-2006 14:55:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> weird
[04-06-2006 14:55:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> but it's probably not very widely happening
[04-06-2006 14:55:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> i have a few friends with breezy and none of them complained about that...
[04-06-2006 14:56:11] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> apparently some say its fixed in a new release of gamin, but that is not included in breezy
[04-06-2006 14:56:28] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> it happens on both my machines :-s
[04-06-2006 14:56:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> as for the dapper, the just fixed the main nuisance
[04-06-2006 14:56:40] [#ezpublish] <zrg> whats gamin
[04-06-2006 14:56:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> namely kdeprinter doing weird things
[04-06-2006 14:56:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> (which is really a cups <-> kdeprinter thing)
[04-06-2006 14:57:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> gamin is the package containing gam_server
[04-06-2006 14:57:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> cant you just purge gamin?
[04-06-2006 14:57:22] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ookay... :P
[04-06-2006 14:57:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> and it does exactly what?
[04-06-2006 14:57:37] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> some gnome compatibility crap..
[04-06-2006 14:57:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> its something like a file monitor i think
[04-06-2006 14:58:04] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> lets see
[04-06-2006 14:58:06] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> apt-get remove gamin

[04-06-2006 14:58:22] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> maybe not
[04-06-2006 14:58:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> apt-get likely wants to remove a shitload of stuff
[04-06-2006 14:58:47] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> looks like there is quite a lot of dependancies on it...
