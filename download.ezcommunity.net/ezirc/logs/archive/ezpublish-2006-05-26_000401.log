[05-25-2006 02:16:29] [#ezpublish] <zr1> in commandline script, and it keeps returning null altho node ID is correct, what could be wrong or how can i see some debug..?
[05-25-2006 02:25:18] [#ezpublish] <zr1> ok seems im missing some cli initialization magic..

[05-25-2006 02:37:20] [#ezpublish] <hovik> you'll need to include the ezscript file as well.: include_once( 'kernel/classes/ezscript.php' );
[05-25-2006 02:45:00] [#ezpublish] <zr1> i was missing $script->initialize(); :D

[05-25-2006 14:50:25] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Hi
[05-25-2006 14:50:36] [#ezpublish] <luke_> ho
[05-25-2006 14:52:43] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I've been troubling with something. I can't figure out how to display search results in an override template for a regular node.
[05-25-2006 14:53:20] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Does the action for the form HAVE to be /content/search/ ?
[05-25-2006 14:53:50] [#ezpublish] <luke_> I saw your forum topic ;)
[05-25-2006 14:54:03] [#ezpublish] <luke_> I guess it's your on ez.no forum
[05-25-2006 14:54:23] [#ezpublish] <luke_> http://ez.no/community/forum/setup_design/how_can_i_include_search_results_in_an_override_template#msg101367
[05-25-2006 14:54:24] [#ezpublish] <luke_> that?
[05-25-2006 14:54:32] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Yea. I guess I'm impatient. :)
[05-25-2006 14:54:37] [#ezpublish] <luke_> haha
[05-25-2006 14:54:47] [#ezpublish] <luke_> set settings in site.ini.append.ph
[05-25-2006 14:54:48] [#ezpublish] <luke_> p
[05-25-2006 14:54:55] [#ezpublish] <luke_> [SearchSettings]
[05-25-2006 14:55:20] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Yes
[05-25-2006 14:55:48] [#ezpublish] <luke_> SearchViewHandling=template
[05-25-2006 14:55:52] [#ezpublish] <luke_> then you can use
[05-25-2006 14:56:05] [#ezpublish] <luke_> ezhttp('searchphrase', 'get')
[05-25-2006 14:56:24] [#ezpublish] <luke_> in the template and provide it to search template function
[05-25-2006 14:56:31] [#ezpublish] <EsP> aha
[05-25-2006 14:57:17] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I tried the SearchViewHandling-setting, but I didn't know the rest.
[05-25-2006 14:57:47] [#ezpublish] <luke_> I guess you will experience view cache issues
[05-25-2006 14:57:58] [#ezpublish] <luke_> so you will need to disable cache for that template
[05-25-2006 14:58:35] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Can I include search.tpl in the template?
[05-25-2006 14:58:42] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Will that work?
[05-25-2006 14:59:15] [#ezpublish] <luke_> It should but you will need to change it I think, add ezsearch
[05-25-2006 14:59:22] [#ezpublish] <luke_> ezhttp I mean
[05-25-2006 15:01:19] [#ezpublish] <EsP> like {include uri='design:search.tpl' search_text='ezhttp("searchphrase","get")'} then?
[05-25-2006 15:01:59] [#ezpublish] <luke_> soemthing like this
[05-25-2006 15:02:33] [#ezpublish] <luke_> but without ''
[05-25-2006 15:02:44] [#ezpublish] <luke_> {include uri='design:search.tpl' search_text=ezhttp("searchphrase","get")}
[05-25-2006 15:02:48] [#ezpublish] <luke_> like this
[05-25-2006 15:03:24] [#ezpublish] <luke_> the in search.tpl you will access it as $search_text
[05-25-2006 15:03:59] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Ok. I love you if this works. :)
[05-25-2006 15:05:06] [#ezpublish] <luke_> :)
[05-25-2006 15:05:08] [#ezpublish] <luke_> try it
[05-25-2006 15:06:09] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I will
[05-25-2006 15:08:49] [#ezpublish] <luke_> if will then don't forget post answer to the topic ;)
