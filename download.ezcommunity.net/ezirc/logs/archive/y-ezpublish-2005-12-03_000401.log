[12-01-2005 01:34:28] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> I've got a contribution I want to make, it's a single class, abstract, that should only be included if another class needs to extend it. Should it be packaged like an extension (ie, with ini file settings at what not) or can it be packaged as a "put it in /kernel/shop/classes and include it when you need it"
[12-01-2005 01:35:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> what's up mc?

[12-01-2005 01:35:32] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> ;)
[12-01-2005 01:36:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hey now ... wouldn't it be "more" correct to simply package your class as an extention (a true extention)
[12-01-2005 01:37:19] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> well I don't know, it seems like unneseccary overhead and complexity, is there an easy way to do it? Because it's not really a true extension, it's just a class.
[12-01-2005 01:37:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> thought being, then it would be a true stand alone extention (proper separation as eZ publish was designed to provide and encourage) and simpler for people to enable or disable ... cleanly
[12-01-2005 01:38:58] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> but it's not the type of thing that needs "enabling" or "disabling" because being abstract, the only time you would need to enable it would be when another class calls it.

[12-01-2005 02:22:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what does it do ?
[12-01-2005 02:23:10] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> It's a extension to eZpaymentgateway
[12-01-2005 02:23:14] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> called eZCurlGateway
[12-01-2005 02:23:47] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> so i'm wondering if I should tell people to install it with the other paymentgateway classes (ie eZredirectgateway)
[12-01-2005 02:24:03] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> which would be in kernel/shop/classes
[12-01-2005 02:24:25] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> or should it sit inside it's own extension directory

[12-01-2005 02:30:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hum, it would probably be a hack you can submit to the community section
[12-01-2005 02:31:38] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> Yeah, it's not really a hack though.
[12-01-2005 02:32:30] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> Because it extends the existing system allowing people to do cURL transactions when checking out (because right now you can old use payment gateways that redirect). It doesn't really overwrite anything.

[12-01-2005 02:41:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> except that the point of the extention functionality is to allow for a complete upgrade or replacement of the kernel/ directorie without loosing any custom modifications, if your puting anything into kernel/  ... you are then kernel hacking, the abstraction exists for a real set of abstraction and separation reasons
[12-01-2005 02:44:41] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> right so how would you properly add a single class, just put it in it's own extension directory?

[12-01-2005 03:48:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's somewhere in the xmlarea thread in the forum
[12-01-2005 03:48:41] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok
[12-01-2005 03:48:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> it might be that the version from SVN works

[12-01-2005 03:48:59] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok
[12-01-2005 03:49:06] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> which file should I update then ?
[12-01-2005 03:49:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> best to check out xmlarea-36 or whatever its name was

[12-01-2005 03:52:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> no

[12-01-2005 05:32:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Does anyone know of an example of how to have an extention depend on another extention (which in turn provides) a needed class file ?

[12-01-2005 05:33:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope, never met that

[12-01-2005 05:36:51] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> Is it kosher to just put the class in it's own extension directory, and just have the classes that need to use it include it with a static link, like include_once('extensions/ezcurlgateway/classes/ezcurlgateway.php')
[12-01-2005 05:47:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'll do some more reading up here in a little bit (preping ... still)
[12-01-2005 05:48:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> on the performance subject. I guess my first thought is that this might be done so far at the begining and so small it could be 'cacheable' or negligable hit on performance or none at all (i know i'm wrong i just don't know how wrong atm)
[12-01-2005 06:02:41] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> but I mean what would you even add to "enable" an abstract class?

I would rather have all the extensions in the extension directory documented and noted in eZ publish site.ini (.append.php) than have (unknown) directories just in the extention/ directory, the then that's just me, perhapse others think it is overkill as well :?
[12-01-2005 06:21:31] [#ezpublish] <mcspectrum> Adding a line to the ini is not that much extra work, I just don't think it's a clean way to implement it, because it would be in the ini not doing anything.

[12-01-2005 09:55:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> otoh, there was a shop with beer right next to highschool so
[12-01-2005 09:55:53] [#ezpublish] <zrg> nah, you would be caught at the gates
[12-01-2005 09:56:09] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but beer on contact with your gut would get warn soon (I haven't read it thoroughly)
[12-01-2005 09:56:14] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> warm
[12-01-2005 09:56:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh point
[12-01-2005 09:56:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> it supposedly is insulated though
[12-01-2005 09:56:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> lets fill in whisky then
[12-01-2005 09:56:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> guys at big rock festival here used to have alcohol-smuggling container exhibition after event
[12-01-2005 09:56:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's supposed to be enjoyed warm
[12-01-2005 09:57:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's it. that's what i could use it for ;)
[12-01-2005 09:57:05] [#ezpublish] <zrg> best idea from there was ethanol-filled wheelchair i think
[12-01-2005 09:57:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> otoh, for 50$ you buy plenty of booze at the event still
[12-01-2005 09:57:57] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi there
[12-01-2005 09:58:05] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> quick question concerning the sections
[12-01-2005 09:58:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yup ?
[12-01-2005 09:58:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I do have a folder node in the standard section
[12-01-2005 09:58:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> the best way tho is to go a week before event and dig some bottles in ground :)
[12-01-2005 09:58:34] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> this node contains other node in standard section
[12-01-2005 09:58:42] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> and 1 node in a specific section
[12-01-2005 09:59:35] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> when displaying the node (full view) the child folder which is not in standard section isn't listed ... Any idea why ?
[12-01-2005 09:59:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> zrg: that only works for places where you can go to easily
[12-01-2005 10:01:45] [#ezpublish] <zrg> true
[12-01-2005 10:02:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> and then there is treasure hunters who try to spot you and will dig out goods :P
[12-01-2005 10:04:24] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kalooni: because the fetch takes into account the eprmissions of the user logged into the siteaccess which contains the tpl you're running.
[12-01-2005 10:05:56] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> sulfur: right :) thx
[12-01-2005 10:07:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> Katana`: didnt you want to solve that a while ago: http://ez.no/community/forum/developer/convert_text_block_xml_block
[12-01-2005 10:11:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yup i wanted to
[12-01-2005 10:11:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> remember my question about why days only have 24 hours ? :)
[12-01-2005 10:15:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> var newday=oldday/2
[12-01-2005 10:15:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> there you are, 48h
[12-01-2005 10:17:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hmm isn't that 12 ?
[12-01-2005 10:18:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> thanks for making my days even shorter buz :)

[12-01-2005 13:02:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> click the copy button after class in admin :)

[12-01-2005 14:11:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> has anyone ever tried to use webdav to store ical files from sunbird?
[12-01-2005 14:17:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hey lukas
[12-01-2005 14:19:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> buz, not in a very long time, and i think i gave up before i got very far into it, though i remember sunbird 11/2004 was feature rich with few bugs (and most people don't say that so ... *shrugs*)
[12-01-2005 14:20:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure if its a sunbird or ez problem, really
[12-01-2005 14:21:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> it looks like i cant upload ical files to webdav with konqi either
[12-01-2005 14:21:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> i can download files generated by the system though
[12-01-2005 14:22:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm
[12-01-2005 14:23:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ez publish has a bit of a history with some webdav compatablity  (in my experiance in the past, re: rename didn't work ... kinda flaky?)
[12-01-2005 14:24:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> i can create folders but file uploads simply dont appear
[12-01-2005 14:25:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> gets weirder
[12-01-2005 14:25:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> jpegs work but not binary files
[12-01-2005 14:26:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> rename works now??
[12-01-2005 14:37:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't think rename works , at least not that I've seen or heard of :\
[12-01-2005 14:38:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> buz, that is wierd
[12-01-2005 14:38:37] [#ezpublish] * kracker crashing ... hard
