[07-07-2006 05:46:20] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> is there a way to fetch all user of a group ?
[07-07-2006 06:11:44] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> kalooni: i bet :)
[07-07-2006 06:12:04] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I'd like to know how ;)
[07-07-2006 06:13:43] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> kalooni: users are a normal content tree
[07-07-2006 06:13:45] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> afaik
[07-07-2006 06:13:53] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I though this too
[07-07-2006 06:14:01] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> so you should be able to use fetch tree or similar
[07-07-2006 06:14:13] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> kalooni: didnt it work?
[07-07-2006 06:14:20] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but did a fetch('content','list',hash('parent_node_id',group_id))  didn't work
[07-07-2006 06:15:06] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> hmmmm
[07-07-2006 06:15:20] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> have you checked the ez templates/modules?
[07-07-2006 06:16:33] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> no i did not
[07-07-2006 06:17:12] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok I understand ... permission issue

[07-07-2006 12:43:22] [#ezpublish] <SunRayCafe> done a few greps, and I can't seem to find anything.
[07-07-2006 12:43:32] [#ezpublish] <SunRayCafe> they're not blobbed, are they?
[07-07-2006 12:44:35] [#ezpublish] <_luke> they are md5 hashed
[07-07-2006 12:45:25] [#ezpublish] <SunRayCafe> the name is hashed?
[07-07-2006 12:45:32] [#ezpublish] <SunRayCafe> so I'd have to hash the name I'm trying to find, and grep that?
[07-07-2006 12:45:43] [#ezpublish] <_luke> yes, the name look on var/(site)/storage/original/application
[07-07-2006 12:45:50] [#ezpublish] <_luke> look on ezbinaryfile table
[07-07-2006 12:45:52] [#ezpublish] <_luke> in the database
[07-07-2006 12:46:02] [#ezpublish] <_luke> there is original file name and hashed name
[07-07-2006 12:46:49] [#ezpublish] <SunRayCafe> aaaah, very cool. Thank you
[07-07-2006 12:46:57] [#ezpublish] <_luke> np ;)
[07-07-2006 12:47:14] [#ezpublish] <SunRayCafe> trying to track down a weird limited scope upload issue, and I'm wondering if certain files had permissions effected.. couldn't find em for the life of me though

[07-07-2006 15:34:18] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> Hi everyone, I managed to reproduce a rather critical content-loss bug in ezpublish earlier today, and was just looking for any email address to notify critical issues to ezsystems, but I can't find anything on the website. I've filed a bug report, but if anyone knows where else I should report this to so the developers know asap, then let me know. Thanks. http://ez.no/bugs/view/8628
[07-07-2006 15:35:14] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> bugreport is sufficent, they look into them
[07-07-2006 15:36:38] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> yeah, i know they look into them. i've reported before, but never anything so serious. thanks zurgutt, i'll leave it at that.
[07-07-2006 15:37:44] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> hmm, looks veery nasty
[07-07-2006 15:38:37] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> fantastic that you managed to track down and reproduce it, most people would not have bothered
[07-07-2006 15:38:43] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> yep. it is... wiped out a lot of files from the first site, some of which we haven't managed to recover :(
[07-07-2006 15:39:39] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> were you in ez conference by chance?
[07-07-2006 15:39:40] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> well i needed too, once it happened again on a different server it had to be ez, and with hundreds of people sharing files i couldn't sit back with the possibility of them getting lost inexplicably.
[07-07-2006 15:39:57] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> yeah, you are right
[07-07-2006 15:41:46] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> no, unfortunately - i would have quite liked to be there, i'm working with ez a lot at the moment
[07-07-2006 15:44:39] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> i'm moving to vancouver in september, so maybe if they have any events out in that area near the new office there i can attend :)
