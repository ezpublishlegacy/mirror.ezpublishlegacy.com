[01-19-2006 20:45:00] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> anyone here symlink a single ezpublish base in order to run mutliple instances of ezpublish?
[01-19-2006 20:46:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sounds dangerious with the db / file concurency issues :(?
[01-19-2006 20:47:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> why not make your changes as a design extension which you can reuse :?
[01-19-2006 20:47:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ez.no is just an extension + stock (from what i've seen recently)
[01-19-2006 20:47:46] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I think thats how a few of the ez hosting partners are doing it
[01-19-2006 20:47:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[01-19-2006 20:48:02] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I'm playing around with the idea
[01-19-2006 20:48:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> whats your core goal
[01-19-2006 20:48:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> with the multi site sharing
[01-19-2006 20:48:22] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> but wondering what the best way to handle directories like design is
[01-19-2006 20:48:34] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> probably cant symlink them very well
[01-19-2006 20:48:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sure, which was why i was asking what your most important goal was so I didn't diatribe down the wrong path
[01-19-2006 20:49:42] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> indeed, 1. conserve disk space 2. Simplify ezp upgrades
[01-19-2006 20:51:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if it's just design +site (configuration) sharing i say go with an extension, if your trying to save database disk space (ugg, i say not worth it), if your trying to save on similar configuration i say go with extension
[01-19-2006 20:52:04] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> good suggestion for me to ponder
[01-19-2006 20:52:54] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> so are you saying run individual sites (seperate domains) as an extension in a common install
[01-19-2006 20:53:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> (rambling) i just think you can run a lot of different sites using a single insallation (what with the ini system allowing different var/ storage, databases, and enabled extensions)
[01-19-2006 20:53:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i could be over simplifying :\ though i think symlinking is dirty in the case you describe ....
[01-19-2006 20:54:05] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> my first approach was just to ln -s /common_ezp_base new-site
[01-19-2006 20:54:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i guess you could use the symlink method
[01-19-2006 20:54:27] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> more testing required :)
[01-19-2006 20:55:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you would want to use the ini system to have a separate var / db per site
[01-19-2006 20:55:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and when i say site, i mean different eZ ini vhost + design configuration
[01-19-2006 20:56:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[01-19-2006 20:56:07] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> so far I don't think its necessary though, it appears that newly added files to new-site are not visible in the base install, thus not common to all sites
[01-19-2006 20:57:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm
[01-19-2006 20:58:44] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> actually thats wrong
[01-19-2006 20:59:02] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> gets messier
[01-19-2006 20:59:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods, yeah ... i was afraid of some of that :(
[01-19-2006 21:00:05] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> means I'd have to exclude common direcotires like design / extensions / settings etc
[01-19-2006 21:00:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ugg
[01-19-2006 21:00:39] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> which then doesn't make upgradding easy anymore..  back to the drawing board
[01-19-2006 21:01:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's dead simple to make a design extension (off the top of my head / blind)
[01-19-2006 21:02:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the rest is a little ini / var setup
[01-19-2006 21:03:08] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> yes your right
[01-19-2006 21:03:37] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> just doesn't seem right somehow running whole sites as an extension, but its just a mindset I guess
[01-19-2006 21:05:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> well eZ publish template system does the looking through the template order (they have docs on this workflow (old once)) ... anyway , i mean regardless. so it isn't a performance hit to use them (that i've seen)
[01-19-2006 21:05:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sigh, wow i sound convoluted as all get out
[01-19-2006 21:06:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't think it's a bastardization, i think it might even be faster , as extension design templates have the highest priortiy in the inclusion workflow order ...
[01-19-2006 21:07:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> just waiting to be wrong of course but ... hey i have made how much using what i think i know about eZ publish
[01-19-2006 21:08:31] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> interesting point
[01-19-2006 21:08:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i used to not understand how people could do it (run as extension) once i started to try it out / figure it out, i was sold on the idea
[01-19-2006 21:10:05] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> you still need to mention it in /settings/override/site.ini though so not 100% isolated
[01-19-2006 21:10:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ahh but there in lies the fun part
[01-19-2006 21:10:33] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> :)
[01-19-2006 21:11:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so you need to point (example) 3 domains (apache vhosts) to the eZ publish dir in question ...
[01-19-2006 21:11:43] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then you need the ini setting to make eZ publish to respond to those domains
[01-19-2006 21:12:12] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> yup
[01-19-2006 21:12:18] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> think I'll test that concept
[01-19-2006 21:12:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but ... only the domains (vhosts) that apache poin to that dir will trigger the ini settings so the `other` ini settings are basicly ignored
[01-19-2006 21:12:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> now i remember
[01-19-2006 21:12:31] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> could be a good approach
[01-19-2006 21:12:43] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i did all of this for a client back in summer / 2005
[01-19-2006 21:13:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> serverfire.com, firriebright.com, ezpublishhosting.com, and two other domains i can't quite remember ( i think i still have copies of that code somewhere)
[01-19-2006 21:14:15] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> you needed code?
[01-19-2006 21:14:31] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> default ezp should be able to handle that I would think
[01-19-2006 21:14:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> huh, no
[01-19-2006 21:15:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i said i have the project source code i used on disk
[01-19-2006 21:15:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> not that i'm very proud of allowing myself to be conn'd by that fucking predator jonathan@firirebright (i never did make anymoney working for him)
[01-19-2006 21:15:15] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> :\
[01-19-2006 22:39:17] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> ezpublish gets confused by having lots of symlinks around the place, it doesn't seem to know where its root is, should have a RootDir= setting in site.ini I reckon
