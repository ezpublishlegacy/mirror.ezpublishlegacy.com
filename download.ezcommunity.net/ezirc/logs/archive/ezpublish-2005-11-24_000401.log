[11-23-2005 03:13:44] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> aaah, this is nice
[11-23-2005 03:14:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> how do I set permissions on a module if that module is part of an extension only loaded for the user siteaccess...
[11-23-2005 03:14:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's not known by the admin so it's not listed in the roles & policies modules list...
[11-23-2005 03:14:35] [#ezpublish] * Katana` pokes eZ people
[11-23-2005 03:19:10] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> add to admin interface. set permission, remove?
[11-23-2005 03:19:14] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> if that's possible :p
[11-23-2005 03:19:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hmmm not a good idea
[11-23-2005 03:19:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> easy :))
[11-23-2005 03:19:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> added [ModuleSettings] ExtensionRepositories[]=myuserext to module.ini.append for admin siteaccess ;)
[11-23-2005 03:21:17] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> but why not a good idea?
[11-23-2005 03:21:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it feels kinda dirty
[11-23-2005 03:22:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> later on "but how was that module permissions set... it's not in the list" ...
[11-23-2005 03:22:13] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> "wait, I think i remember something !"
[11-23-2005 03:22:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and totally impossible since my extension has a big settings folder with override.ini and so on ;)
[11-23-2005 03:22:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> I doubt the admin would work with that extension loaded

[11-23-2005 09:54:31] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> seems that eZPersistentObject::fetchObjectList is no good ....

[11-23-2005 09:58:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I first take up the definition by loading the class , so I nhave a $class->definition()
