[03-20-2006 04:15:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> has anyone got gallery templates with user selectable number of images per page / image size?
[03-20-2006 04:25:57] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no sorry
[03-20-2006 04:26:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> where would the choices save?
[03-20-2006 04:26:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> ezpreference
[03-20-2006 04:28:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's really a rather trivial change but i'm lazy ;)
[03-20-2006 04:28:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> think i have heard it mentioned, easy to use?
[03-20-2006 04:28:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[03-20-2006 04:28:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> very simple really
[03-20-2006 04:29:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> of course, caching can bite you but you can take care of that
[03-20-2006 04:29:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> http://triligon.org/triligon/playground/test_3_forum_object_id_467 makes use of it to let the user chose the layout of threads

[03-20-2006 04:31:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> 10 thumbs is kinda little on a big screen
[03-20-2006 04:36:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> do you know of some forum templateset that actually looks good and works well?

[03-20-2006 04:47:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> zrg: http://ez.no/products/ez_publish/documentation/reference/template_operators/data_extraction/ezpreference
[03-20-2006 04:47:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> refreshingly simple ;)
[03-20-2006 04:48:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> how about anonymous?
[03-20-2006 04:48:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> stored in session ithink
[03-20-2006 04:49:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok so changes will work but not save?
[03-20-2006 04:49:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> well will stay as long as he's on the site
[03-20-2006 04:49:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> just not be persisted for the next visit i guess
[03-20-2006 04:49:44] [#ezpublish] <zrg> what about defaults?
[03-20-2006 04:49:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> that i'm currently trying to figure out ;)
[03-20-2006 04:50:26] [#ezpublish] <zrg> looking at this would be nice if you can say in conf taht in case user has it not set, the value comes from THAT user
[03-20-2006 04:51:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> otherwise you would have to manage defaults in every instance, which is stupid
[03-20-2006 04:51:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> seems like one has to do that
[03-20-2006 04:51:24] [#ezpublish] <zrg> blah :P
[03-20-2006 04:51:40] [#ezpublish] <zrg> not quite there, as usual ;)
[03-20-2006 04:52:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah i'm currently wrestling with default
[03-20-2006 04:52:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> a default of 0 is kinda dangerous for the limit of a big gallery ;)
[03-20-2006 04:53:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> lotsa pages :P
[03-20-2006 04:53:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> no
[03-20-2006 04:53:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> lots of images on ONE page
[03-20-2006 04:53:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> which means lots of image rescaling on first visit
[03-20-2006 04:53:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> well divide number of images by 0 . aiieeee!
[03-20-2006 04:53:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> or maybe default is NULL

[03-20-2006 07:04:02] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> Question to ppl who have upgraded Online Editor:
[03-20-2006 07:04:38] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> We just upgraded to OE 4.0.2 from 2.0 and realized that the Name-attribute of the upload-new form is no longer present.
[03-20-2006 07:06:01] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> Have you:
[03-20-2006 07:06:02] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> Experieced this?
[03-20-2006 07:06:02] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> knowledge of any reason or feature backing this up?
[03-20-2006 07:06:02] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> Know how to get it back?
[03-20-2006 07:08:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> anyone get any idea why the following template code does not what it should:
[03-20-2006 07:08:49] [#ezpublish] <buz>         {let page_limit=ezpreference("imagesperpage")}
[03-20-2006 07:08:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> 
[03-20-2006 07:08:57] [#ezpublish] <buz>             {if gt($page_limit, 50)}
[03-20-2006 07:09:01] [#ezpublish] <buz>                 {set page_limit=50}
[03-20-2006 07:09:05] [#ezpublish] <buz>             {/if}
[03-20-2006 07:09:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> 
[03-20-2006 07:09:13] [#ezpublish] <buz>             {if lt($page_limit, 4)}
[03-20-2006 07:09:17] [#ezpublish] <buz>                 {set page_limit=8}
[03-20-2006 07:09:18] [#ezpublish] <buz>             {/if}
[03-20-2006 07:09:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> i often get page_limit=8 when it should be left alone???
[03-20-2006 07:12:41] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> what´s the value of $page_limit in these cases?
[03-20-2006 07:12:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> in between 4 and 50
[03-20-2006 07:12:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> its a weird bug i think
[03-20-2006 07:13:16] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> weird indeed
[03-20-2006 07:13:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> could be a caching bug
[03-20-2006 07:13:59] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> thats the only thing i could think of
[03-20-2006 07:14:32] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> the code itself seems failsafe
[03-20-2006 07:14:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[03-20-2006 07:14:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> yet weird things happen
[03-20-2006 07:15:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh
[03-20-2006 07:15:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> looks like  {cache-block keys=array($node.node_id, ezpreference("imagesperpage"))} wont work
[03-20-2006 07:15:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> no that works
[03-20-2006 07:15:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> but only using $node doesnt
[03-20-2006 07:15:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> ah well at least it works now ;)
[03-20-2006 07:16:22] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> yea, $node can be tricky in case of cache
[03-20-2006 07:16:44] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> what about using $node_result
[03-20-2006 07:16:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's a full template
[03-20-2006 07:17:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> $node should be exactly that
[03-20-2006 07:17:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> but it might be some reference weirdness with $node as a composite object
[03-20-2006 07:17:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> node_id is leaner anyway
[03-20-2006 07:17:35] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> ok (and $module_result whas what i meant of cause)
[03-20-2006 07:18:07] [#ezpublish] <bOkO_> buz: yuo´re using Online editor?

[03-20-2006 17:00:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> mhmh
[03-20-2006 17:01:08] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: http://img146.imageshack.us/my.php?image=pic0bm.jpg how could this happend? <input fields are not displayed at all! :-(
[03-20-2006 17:02:18] [#ezpublish] <zrg> dont know what you mean
[03-20-2006 17:02:27] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: have you looked at the page
[03-20-2006 17:02:27] [#ezpublish] <phretor> ?
[03-20-2006 17:02:32] [#ezpublish] <zrg> sure
[03-20-2006 17:02:43] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: that should be the default registration page for new users
[03-20-2006 17:03:04] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: it sometimes shows <input> fields but sometimes no
[03-20-2006 17:04:35] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: imagine this (http://ez.no/user/register) without <input> fields; it's exactly what is happening to me
[03-20-2006 17:05:08] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no idea
[03-20-2006 17:05:19] [#ezpublish] <zrg> look if they are in source, look in debug
[03-20-2006 17:05:44] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: they are not in HTML source
[03-20-2006 17:07:33] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: never happened before
[03-20-2006 17:08:05] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: beside caching, is there something I could do for "resetting" the system or something like that?
[03-20-2006 17:10:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> clear all caches done?
[03-20-2006 17:11:20] [#ezpublish] <zrg> turn on debug, look for errors
[03-20-2006 17:11:50] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: no errors
[03-20-2006 17:12:05] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: it's maybe due to the ViewCaching=disabled
[03-20-2006 17:12:28] [#ezpublish] <zrg> disabling viewcache makes everything work better
[03-20-2006 17:14:09] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: suppose that you would change the default loginpagelayout.tpl; do you override or create a new mydesign/templates/loginpagelayout.tpl?
[03-20-2006 17:17:10] [#ezpublish] <zrg> always override, never change default templates
[03-20-2006 17:18:24] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: not changing the default template
[03-20-2006 17:19:18] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: the default template remains into design/standard/templates/loginpagelayout.tpl; I'll define a new design/mydesign/templates/loginpagelayout.tpl
[03-20-2006 17:19:45] [#ezpublish] <zrg> oh, i have never done that
[03-20-2006 17:20:32] [#ezpublish] <zrg> always have done override, clearer in my opinion
[03-20-2006 17:21:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> only have "addon" templates in mydesign/templates, which do not have analog in standard set
[03-20-2006 17:22:17] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: there is a basic problem with eZpublish itself
[03-20-2006 17:22:28] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ?
[03-20-2006 17:24:34] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: I don't like the two sites to be so independent; I'd prefer the 'admin' site to be left for administrative/editing purposes only - i.e., a user should not be able to login into the 'public' site...did you get what I mean? It's maybe a little complicated
[03-20-2006 17:25:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you dont like the user to go to admin to edit?
[03-20-2006 17:25:19] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: no, the contrary
[03-20-2006 17:25:41] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: I'd like to keep the public site for view only and the admin site for editing/admin only
[03-20-2006 17:25:58] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok so whats the problem?
[03-20-2006 17:26:22] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: I don't like to user to be able to, for example, log in into the 'public' site
[03-20-2006 17:26:32] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: but it's just an example
[03-20-2006 17:29:06] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: did you get the idea?
[03-20-2006 17:29:10] [#ezpublish] <zrg> if you want no logins in public siteaccess, turn them off in permissioins
[03-20-2006 17:30:49] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: yes, I know, but it's not a matter of login/logout - it's a more high-level concept; I'd prefer to _completely_ separate the two aspects; admin is for logged user only, public is for not-logged in users only
[03-20-2006 17:38:04] [#ezpublish] <zrg> well i dont get it, describe in more earthly terms then :P
[03-20-2006 17:38:18] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i dont let my users into admin at all.
[03-20-2006 17:39:02] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: how do you allow them to edit?
[03-20-2006 17:40:10] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no problem there, just stick in edit button, it almost all works as well in public layout
[03-20-2006 17:40:43] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: and do you need big changes in the default way/templates?
[03-20-2006 17:40:46] [#ezpublish] <zrg> and much easier for simple users
[03-20-2006 17:40:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> not at all
[03-20-2006 17:41:07] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: I'll check it out, thanks man
[03-20-2006 17:41:49] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: and what if a user want to add a new, say, Article?
[03-20-2006 17:42:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> want a template that does it all?
[03-20-2006 17:42:30] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: I want the easiest way
[03-20-2006 17:42:46] [#ezpublish] <phretor> :-)
[03-20-2006 17:45:36] [#ezpublish] <zrg> http://pastebin.com/613458
[03-20-2006 17:46:27] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: moreover, I'd love to have a more rapid way to edit policies/roles :-( it's amazingly boring
[03-20-2006 17:47:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> save in mydesign/templates/quickedit.tpl
[03-20-2006 17:47:41] [#ezpublish] <phretor> ok, then?
[03-20-2006 17:47:58] [#ezpublish] <zrg> put into pagelayout:
[03-20-2006 17:47:59] [#ezpublish] <zrg> {include uri='design:quickedit.tpl'}
[03-20-2006 17:47:59] [#ezpublish] <zrg>  <div class="break"></div>
[03-20-2006 17:47:59] [#ezpublish] <zrg>         {$module_result.content}
[03-20-2006 17:48:04] [#ezpublish] <zrg> thats it
[03-20-2006 17:48:29] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: will it work for logged in users only?
[03-20-2006 17:48:52] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yes
[03-20-2006 17:49:07] [#ezpublish] <phretor> how about speeding up the policy editing task?
[03-20-2006 17:49:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> one extra goodie in there, look at portion which has ezini( 'PerGroupClassLimits', concat('ClassLimit_', $user_group_id, '_', $class.id), 'limits.ini' )
[03-20-2006 17:50:05] [#ezpublish] <phretor> ok, so that?
[03-20-2006 17:50:24] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you can have limit for each user there, how many objects of given class he can have
[03-20-2006 17:51:10] [#ezpublish] <zrg> for example set it 1 for guest users and blog class, so each guest can only create 1 blog
[03-20-2006 17:52:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> policy editing is tedious but you only have to do it once
[03-20-2006 17:54:05] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: my policies are very simple but I'm not so expert :-( basically I have three kinds of roles: (1) admin (everything, all siteaccess), (2) researchers (editing/creating  only in public siteaccess onlye), (3) studends (editing only in public siteaccess only)
[03-20-2006 17:58:21] [#ezpublish] <zrg> these are user groups, roles are at more lower level
[03-20-2006 17:59:03] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: roles are the way to edit/assign policies, isn't it?
[03-20-2006 17:59:51] [#ezpublish] <zrg> like blog user, forum user, forum moderator, content editor
[03-20-2006 18:00:32] [#ezpublish] <zrg> and then assign these roles to groups, with additional limitations
[03-20-2006 18:00:32] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: ok man, I gotta go
[03-20-2006 18:01:15] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: thanks for your help
[03-20-2006 18:01:29] [#ezpublish] <zrg> sure
[03-20-2006 18:01:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> come back :)
