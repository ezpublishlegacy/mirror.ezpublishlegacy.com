[12-06-2005 02:59:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> Katana`: you got code around to fetch only the module result html (no stuff around it, no header nothing) for ajax?
[12-06-2005 03:07:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hummmm
[12-06-2005 03:07:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> for content ?
[12-06-2005 03:08:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-06-2005 03:09:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i haven't done that...
[12-06-2005 03:09:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> how does your ajax work then
[12-06-2005 03:10:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i don't return HTML using AJAX :)
[12-06-2005 03:18:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> buz, is thinking of the new ajax like catch phrase that is designed *to* return html (i forget the latest keyword hype they are using for that)
[12-06-2005 03:18:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> the qooxdoo interface doesnt go fetch html?
[12-06-2005 03:20:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i don't see why it would
[12-06-2005 03:20:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it uses an object oriented API to generate components
[12-06-2005 03:20:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> of course it can display HTML
[12-06-2005 03:20:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but i don't use it like that

[12-06-2005 04:12:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> my machine keeps crashing today
[12-06-2005 04:12:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> xorg freezes and only reboot helps
[12-06-2005 04:12:16] [#ezpublish] <buz> (i can still login by ssh, weird)
[12-06-2005 04:13:18] [#ezpublish] <Proteque_> buz: what brand is your computer.
[12-06-2005 04:13:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> self made
[12-06-2005 04:13:52] [#ezpublish] <Proteque_> a lot of ppl have that problem with ibm netvistas. that io gets out of hand and the computer freezes completly.
[12-06-2005 04:14:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> well
[12-06-2005 04:14:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> ssh still worked
[12-06-2005 04:14:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> but killing xorg did not

[12-06-2005 04:37:35] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> anyone noticed the new http://ez.no design?
[12-06-2005 04:38:29] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes my sweet critically-damaged eyes
[12-06-2005 04:38:38] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ow ow ow
[12-06-2005 04:38:50] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> :P
[12-06-2005 04:39:19] [#ezpublish] <Proteque_> yes.
[12-06-2005 04:39:29] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> haha
[12-06-2005 04:39:41] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I think it still needs some work on its use of the spaces (i.e. scrollbars appearing in documentation navbar where it isn't needed and gobbles up space)
[12-06-2005 04:39:56] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> yes
[12-06-2005 04:40:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> and maybe a little work on the colors to make it more easy on the eyes
[12-06-2005 04:41:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> it's a step towards a printable version, tho' (I think)
[12-06-2005 05:00:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ... anyone has ever used the url translation / nice url features in admin panel?
[12-06-2005 05:02:07] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> does ez have an default printsetting/css/thingie? or do one have to make one?
[12-06-2005 05:16:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> it has
[12-06-2005 05:16:29] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> look print_pagelayout.tpl

[12-06-2005 05:47:03] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> seems like I found something weird on ezurl
[12-06-2005 05:59:23] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> is there a way to access current page url from within a template? or even better, to know if I am in "print version" mode?

[12-06-2005 08:07:16] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> I want to have a link to create articles to PDF. Do I use content_pdf_gui
[12-06-2005 08:07:16] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_>  for that?
[12-06-2005 08:12:36] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> dunno, I use my own way of doing them  :P
[12-06-2005 08:12:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> which is?
[12-06-2005 08:14:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> buz: I was talking about pdf - anyway I use ros.co.nz lib
[12-06-2005 08:14:30] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> I find the doc confusing on this subject
[12-06-2005 08:14:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> Sulfur: i know you're referring to the pdf
[12-06-2005 08:14:49] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> which, incidentally, it's the same used by eZ, save that they have it all wrapped into their code and it's a pain to use that way
[12-06-2005 08:14:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> (no parameter passing possible etc)
[12-06-2005 08:15:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> basically, you can only use it to display single nodes as it is now
[12-06-2005 08:15:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> no aggregate/dummy nodes
[12-06-2005 08:16:03] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> and that's bad every time in which you need to present e.g. a calendar, a table, and so on
[12-06-2005 08:16:29] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> while now I am quite pleased with the achievements
[12-06-2005 08:20:45] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm i can't seem to get the toolbar-top do display correctly in firefox - it's okey in opera and ie - anyone been thru this ? :D
[12-06-2005 08:24:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> nope..
[12-06-2005 08:26:53] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I ask again ... is there a way to "know" from within a template if I am currently rendering the print version ?

[12-06-2005 08:57:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> Katana`: I was unable to find it in $module_result.somestuff_info.view ; it shows "full" even if I am using the layout. it's "correct" as the view tpl is the one for full, but it is the _layout_ here that is the print one
[12-06-2005 08:57:32] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> anyway, I don't feel very well so I am going home now ... bye

[12-06-2005 14:08:31] [#ezpublish] <zr1> uh, using recursive includes, isnt this hellisly inefficient?
[12-06-2005 14:09:37] [#ezpublish] <zr1> i think ordinary loops would be better?
[12-06-2005 14:13:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> how could i achieve that with loops?
[12-06-2005 14:13:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> keeping track of my own stack? in template language?
[12-06-2005 14:17:32] [#ezpublish] <zr1> surely more efficient than includes
