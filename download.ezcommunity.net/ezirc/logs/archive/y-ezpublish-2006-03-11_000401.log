[03-09-2006 04:03:11] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> good morning ;)
[03-09-2006 04:03:30] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I have a problem with images insertion
[03-09-2006 04:03:42] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> seems there is a problem when creating variations
[03-09-2006 04:03:53] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> any idea of what could be the reason ?

[03-09-2006 04:48:51] [#ezpublish] <xbit> kalooni: missing gd or imagemagick?
[03-09-2006 04:49:37] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> The error message say: Unknown destination file : ...
[03-09-2006 04:50:00] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but I asked to the admin sys, and it seems he has made some modifications to php
[03-09-2006 04:50:22] [#ezpublish] <xbit> mmh, probably his fault then :)
[03-09-2006 04:50:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> So I think he removed the "right" to php to exec files
[03-09-2006 04:51:00] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> He will made the change and I think it will be ok
[03-09-2006 04:51:48] [#ezpublish] <xbit> good stuff :9
[03-09-2006 04:52:20] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> kalooni: do you have customized your image.ini?
[03-09-2006 04:52:29] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> nob i didn't
[03-09-2006 04:52:44] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but: I am storing files into a custom VarDir
[03-09-2006 04:52:48] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> var/client
[03-09-2006 04:52:54] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but the rights are ok ...
[03-09-2006 04:55:56] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> does the varDir need to be the same for admin siteaccess and "plain" one ?
[03-09-2006 04:56:05] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> or can they be different?
[03-09-2006 05:47:43] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> kalooni: they must be the same
[03-09-2006 05:48:13] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok thanks

[03-09-2006 07:18:05] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm so if i export the pubsvn stable 3.7, i get all the bugfixes and stuff for the 3.7.3 ? :)
[03-09-2006 07:26:37] [#ezpublish] <hovik> yes.
[03-09-2006 07:30:15] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> nnn0: except the ids for all the files, so upgrade-check won't work...

[03-09-2006 07:44:44] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> so it's better to install 3.7.3 and then run the patches ?
[03-09-2006 07:49:02] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm maybe i misunderstood - this is a clean install - so you're saying i wouldn't be able to upgrade it ?
[03-09-2006 07:50:56] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no.. if you go to admin->setup->upgrade-check -> check file-consistency.. it will not work if you export from svn
