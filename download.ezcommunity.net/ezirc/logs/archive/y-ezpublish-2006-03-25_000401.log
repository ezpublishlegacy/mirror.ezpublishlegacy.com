[03-23-2006 03:44:31] [#ezpublish] <_buz_> useful test would be to install it on some site of your own ;)

[03-23-2006 03:46:38] [#ezpublish] <_buz_> it seems to work quite well now

[03-23-2006 04:10:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> anyway very interesting, throw me a package to test

[03-23-2006 04:15:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> well not that important, but some kind of browsing to pick images is
[03-23-2006 04:16:00] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it does not break something in ez, like making content incompatible?
[03-23-2006 04:16:03] [#ezpublish] <_buz_> i want to add some sort of ajax
[03-23-2006 04:16:05] [#ezpublish] <_buz_> yes it does
[03-23-2006 04:16:10] [#ezpublish] <_buz_> it uses straight xhtml
[03-23-2006 04:17:31] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ah, crap
[03-23-2006 04:18:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> the xml is pain in ass but it also has useful stuff, keeping internal links valid etc

[03-23-2006 04:19:30] [#ezpublish] <_buz> its just not entirely compatible i think
[03-23-2006 04:19:35] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but the functionality is there
[03-23-2006 04:19:54] [#ezpublish] <_buz> try doing an internal link and look at the code it generates
[03-23-2006 04:25:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> mm yeah, seems so
[03-23-2006 04:25:52] [#ezpublish] <_buz_> but for images it currently somehow gets screwed
[03-23-2006 04:25:56] [#ezpublish] <_buz_> will fix that
