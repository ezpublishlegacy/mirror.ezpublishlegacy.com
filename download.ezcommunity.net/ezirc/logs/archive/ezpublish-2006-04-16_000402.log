[04-15-2006 06:21:46] [#ezpublish] <phretor> hello folks
[04-15-2006 06:24:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> phretor: i just committed some bug fixes for EOR
[04-15-2006 06:24:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> not related to the required attribute stuff though
[04-15-2006 06:24:50] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz, anyway they're appreciated :-)
[04-15-2006 06:25:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's now possible to create objects that contain EOR attributes too
[04-15-2006 06:25:42] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz, btw, so you do you definitely confirm that Required field flag is not currently supported. Right?
[04-15-2006 06:25:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> seems like it
[04-15-2006 06:26:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> i asked xavier about it but he's not around
[04-15-2006 06:26:04] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz, any workaround?
[04-15-2006 06:26:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> i couldnt get it to work myself
[04-15-2006 06:26:10] [#ezpublish] <phretor> me too
[04-15-2006 06:26:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[04-15-2006 06:26:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> hack the code ;)
[04-15-2006 06:26:15] [#ezpublish] <phretor> lol
[04-15-2006 06:26:39] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz, it'd be actually a solution :-)
[04-15-2006 06:26:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[04-15-2006 06:27:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> workaround: educate the users
[04-15-2006 06:27:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> but solving it is likely easier
[04-15-2006 06:34:25] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz, got suggestions?
[04-15-2006 06:34:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> for what
[04-15-2006 06:35:25] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz, for a hack
[04-15-2006 06:35:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> not really
