[06-18-2006 15:18:58] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> do you know why the publishing of an article is terribly slow?

[06-18-2006 15:19:32] [#ezpublish] <the-kracker> hrm ... back to 3.7.6  i guess

[06-18-2006 15:22:08] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> hi, i wonder if anyone can help... i just upgraded an ez site on our server to 3.8 for a friend, and lots of the content was missing from the user site. it turns out it was because the site was set up incorrectly to begin with, and all the content was set as eng-GB even though it's in german. i had added SiteLanguageList[]=ger-DE and so with the new multilingual infrastructure that meant the 'english' content wasn't
[06-18-2006 15:22:55] [#ezpublish] <the-kracker> weak, i wonder if that might be why my migration failed :\
[06-18-2006 15:27:08] [#ezpublish] <the-kracker> after running the db migration sql and scripts ..
[06-18-2006 15:28:38] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> it could be interesting an import and export function
[06-18-2006 15:28:53] [#ezpublish] <the-kracker> i get a rather scarry error: There are more then one main_node for objectID
[06-18-2006 15:28:56] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> for your case the-kracker
[06-18-2006 15:46:43] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> ok, i did some database searching, and 'eng-GB' shows up in ezcontent_language(1) ezcontentobject_attribute(1730) ezcontentobject_name(368) ezimagefile(317) and ezsession(30)... obviously ezsession doesn't matter - i can clear that. any advice on procedure for fixing the language elsewhere - i can just run some sql to change it everywhere, but i don't know enough about the multilingual internals to be confident
[06-18-2006 16:17:55] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> ok, well if anyone feels like replying: http://ez.no/community/forum/install_configuration/how_to_change_language_of_mis_configured_3_8_site
