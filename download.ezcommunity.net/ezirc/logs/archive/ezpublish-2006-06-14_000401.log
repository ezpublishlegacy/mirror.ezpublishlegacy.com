[06-13-2006 02:13:02] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> B-KiLLer`: You mean like uploading two images for each content-object, and make javascript switch between them?
[06-13-2006 02:13:57] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yep, something like this
[06-13-2006 02:14:07] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> but not really "upload", because those images are part of the design
[06-13-2006 02:14:21] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> my idea was to associate in a .ini file, the node / image_file_name
[06-13-2006 02:14:37] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> and then, while displaying the menu, doing some |ezimage, with the content from that .ini
[06-13-2006 02:21:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> B-KiLLer`: that also works.
[06-13-2006 02:21:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i have done something similar

[06-13-2006 10:44:12] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> if not, then you could open the concerned file and try to follow up that "bug", maybe you could see the reason, just looking at the code

[06-13-2006 15:44:01] [#ezpublish] <xigleth> but not a huge problem for me as I know how to fix it ;-)
[06-13-2006 15:44:23] [#ezpublish] <yper> installed 3.8 as forum site. Added packages gallery and contacts

[06-13-2006 15:50:04] [#ezpublish] <yper> ls: the function that crashes for me has to do with Exif data extraction it seems. its a foreach loop that runs in my case 15 times 0-14 (added a counter) and the last time calls it calls the $itemValueNode->node_value(); it crashes since this time strangly enough there is no object in $itemValueNode
