[05-11-2005 15:07:31] [#ezpublish] <fh> invite?
[05-11-2005 15:07:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i thought i might clarify (since i took the time to write up the document), i was talking out loud this morning about real bugs / inconsistenccies in the forum templates.
[05-11-2005 15:08:17] [#ezpublish] <kracker> which i feel need to be addressed, which are different from people just bitching about the forums (in general)
[05-11-2005 15:08:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> tho, in honesty i tacked a little of that on at the very bottom
[05-11-2005 15:09:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i got the impresssion from you that you thought i was talking about eZ publish 4.0 forum (source code) when i was really talking specificly about ez.no's forum templates which have all these little inconsistense between each view / template
[05-11-2005 15:09:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i got disconnected before i saw your original responce
[05-11-2005 15:11:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i guess what i was really trying to find out is if you understood my clearly
[05-11-2005 15:12:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and if i should still send that document to you or another ...
[05-11-2005 15:15:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i guess i wasn't clear enough earlier this morning ... for that I apologize
[05-11-2005 15:15:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> darn irc, kicks me so infrequently it is really hard to have a complete conversation
[05-11-2005 15:24:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kracker: hmm ... what is the reason for frequent disconnect?
[05-11-2005 15:25:22] [#ezpublish] <fh> ah, ok
[05-11-2005 15:25:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> isp or irc-server?
[05-11-2005 15:25:27] [#ezpublish] <fh> yes, then i misunderstood
[05-11-2005 15:25:47] [#ezpublish] <fh> I thought you were talking about eZ publish standard templates
[05-11-2005 15:26:01] [#ezpublish] <fh> if you are talking about ez.no templates you should send your suggestions to ole (oh@ez.no)

[05-11-2005 15:47:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i have to get off windows so the fsf / gnu montra (duo) in my head will let me sleep well at night

[05-11-2005 15:48:26] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, just leave window behind you and never look back ;)
[05-11-2005 15:48:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'll find out later this month on my next business trip
[05-11-2005 15:49:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's just hard when you support windows clients (prt time) ... to cut it out at first ..
[05-11-2005 15:49:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> FH: thank and i will ..
[05-11-2005 15:49:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> FH: thanks and i will .
[05-11-2005 15:50:12] [#ezpublish] <fh> good :)
[05-11-2005 15:50:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> tho honestly, i see lots of people get disconnected (timouts) like me so ... perhapse it could be the irc network (freenode does it more for me than anyother network)
[05-11-2005 15:50:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> FH: why does ez systems host #ezpublish with freenode?
[05-11-2005 15:50:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> or better yet, who hosts #ezpublish (who set it up ?)
[05-11-2005 15:52:03] [#ezpublish] <fh> freenode is the old openprojects network (for open source projects)
[05-11-2005 15:52:16] [#ezpublish] <fh> so we just used that a few years back
[05-11-2005 15:52:18] [#ezpublish] <fh> and it stuck
[05-11-2005 15:52:24] [#ezpublish] <fh> even if the network name changed
[05-11-2005 15:53:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> right... i'll have to write that up in my snippets
[05-11-2005 15:53:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> thnx
[05-11-2005 15:53:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well ... have not so many connections like kracker.
[05-11-2005 15:53:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +prblems
[05-11-2005 15:53:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> is it wrong to question the quality of the hosting? i mean in all fairness it could be my own damb fault but ...
[05-11-2005 15:54:09] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> just define a unique freenode server to connect to.
[05-11-2005 15:55:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh? sry i don't follow?
[05-11-2005 15:56:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm .. it depends how u connect to the freenode network.
[05-11-2005 15:56:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[05-11-2005 15:56:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> mind if i ask how you do so?
[05-11-2005 15:56:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> what irc-client u are using?
[05-11-2005 15:56:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> special port, special dns name, (mIrc)
[05-11-2005 15:56:45] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i use irssi to connect.
[05-11-2005 15:57:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> irc.eu.freenode.com port 6667 could be used.
[05-11-2005 15:57:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[05-11-2005 15:57:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'll give it a shot
[05-11-2005 15:57:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hell, i'll give anything a shot at this point in time
[05-11-2005 15:58:22] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i could define a separate network, like krackers_freenode and add the mentionend server to it.
[05-11-2005 15:58:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh? hey wait a sec? you admin some of freenode?
[05-11-2005 15:59:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm, ok, interest, cool. i don't want you to go to that much effort (just yet) just for me. let me test this out and get back to you ...
