[06-09-2006 02:03:13] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> is it possible to pass variable to the pagelayout

[06-09-2006 02:36:31] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> DiGiTa|_: pass from where?
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> a prehome page
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> if its from the URL, you should use view parameters
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it's not in a node view
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> they work if the site is cached.
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> like this /(parameter)/value
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i know view_parameters
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> ok :-)
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> good :-)
[06-09-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> but i cannot use them into the pagelayout
[06-09-2006 02:41:41] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> right.. that is only available when viewing a node..
[06-09-2006 02:42:11] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> you are right offcourse.. because the non-node.views do not use view-caching..
[06-09-2006 02:42:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> so GET parameters is fine..
[06-09-2006 02:42:35] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :)
[06-09-2006 02:42:54] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i'm always right :p

[06-09-2006 04:12:17] [#ezpublish] <awormus> I have a question about a cross domain login system, I'm not sure if it falls under a SSO system.
[06-09-2006 04:12:48] [#ezpublish] <awormus> I want to use a eZpublish site as a forum to compliment and existing news based site.
[06-09-2006 04:13:19] [#ezpublish] <awormus> so after every article I would like to have a "Discuss this articles on My New Site Name"
[06-09-2006 04:13:31] [#ezpublish] <awormus> the discussion site would be powered by eZpublish
[06-09-2006 04:14:14] [#ezpublish] <awormus> any ideas for simple strategies to handle the logins between sites? I don't want the users to have to log into the eZpublish site...
[06-09-2006 04:14:23] [#ezpublish] <awormus> anyone done it?
