[03-31-2006 05:16:00] [#ezpublish] <niooi> We're having a difficulty with the workflow process: We would like to have users able to join objects, add articles, etc in a folder they have just created. The problem is that the user is not able to add anything to an object until this object is validated and published.
[03-31-2006 05:16:57] [#ezpublish] <niooi> How could we allow users to add subelements to an object they've just created if that object isn't published yet?

[03-31-2006 07:08:48] [#ezpublish] <niooi> The scope goes beyond folders, we need the user to create any class and to attach object under a class, but the problem is that until the object is not published the user cannot add any subelement
[03-31-2006 07:09:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> why does it have to be a subelement?
[03-31-2006 07:11:43] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> niooi: one thing i have in mind. seperate the editors area and the frontpage ( i guess its a webpage )
[03-31-2006 07:11:59] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> then allow the users to publish imediately in editorial area
[03-31-2006 07:12:21] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> oh no not working ... sorry
[03-31-2006 07:12:26] [#ezpublish] <niooi> let me explain :(wait I'll type the rest)
[03-31-2006 07:14:10] [#ezpublish] <niooi> We've created several object classes (links, forms, galleries, articles, etc.) and we need the user to be able to attached as many elements as possible to an article
[03-31-2006 07:14:33] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> what means attach?
[03-31-2006 07:14:39] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> cant you use object relations?
[03-31-2006 07:14:44] [#ezpublish] <niooi> but until the article is not published/validated by an adminsitrator the user won't be able to attach any elements to that parent article"
[03-31-2006 07:14:59] [#ezpublish] <niooi> no subelements
[03-31-2006 07:15:23] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> hmmmm
[03-31-2006 07:15:30] [#ezpublish] <niooi> those are not related objects but sub-elements (maybe we did a mistake in our design)
[03-31-2006 07:17:45] [#ezpublish] <niooi> we've realized this limitation one week before finish the site... and we are quite stuck with it
[03-31-2006 07:18:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> stuck like why
[03-31-2006 07:21:26] [#ezpublish] <niooi> stuck in the workflow works let me explain
[03-31-2006 07:24:25] [#ezpublish] <niooi> The user is supposed to create an, for example, an article and to attach sub-elements to it like images, other articles, videos, etc. This is what we called a "dossier".  But the way eZ Publish works, or as far as we understand how it works, it requires a validation/publish of the parent article (the first one) to be able to add subelements. As far as the parent article "dossier" is not published by an administrator the user does not have the ri
[03-31-2006 07:24:25] [#ezpublish] <niooi> ghts to add any elements to it.
[03-31-2006 07:25:17] [#ezpublish] <niooi> that where the problem lies
[03-31-2006 07:28:57] [#ezpublish] <niooi> We'd like the user to create a 'dossier' full of elements to be validated by the administrator in a single row. Now the dossier would have to be created step by step: first the parent article (created and then published), next step whern the parent article has been published by an adminsitratorthe user add new elements to that parents
[03-31-2006 07:29:19] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I hope I was clear enough
[03-31-2006 07:37:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> ah well
[03-31-2006 07:38:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> thats probably really best done with children
[03-31-2006 07:41:55] [#ezpublish] <niooi> So this is what we were scared about: to change the whole design. So you mean we should use related object?
[03-31-2006 07:42:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure if your intended workflow would make sense with it
[03-31-2006 07:42:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> what you could do:
[03-31-2006 07:42:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> publish the objects immediately but under a section thats not public ?
[03-31-2006 07:42:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> then have the admin change sections when he gives the ok for public view?
[03-31-2006 07:45:50] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> doesn't ez support setting discount for a group on a subtree?
[03-31-2006 07:47:11] [#ezpublish] <niooi> That's what I thought

[03-31-2006 12:03:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> instead of having even more extnesions ;)
[03-31-2006 12:03:48] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> haha
[03-31-2006 12:04:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm
[03-31-2006 12:04:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> writing extensions for something like that takes longer than to develop the feature
[03-31-2006 12:05:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i did slow it down to keep it from being same day, to 4 or so days to also write the 10 pages of text written to go along with the upgrade 'project'
[03-31-2006 12:05:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> then more than 600 is surely ok
[03-31-2006 12:07:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> alright, this is good to know to help keep me ballanced/from selling myself out so low. do you think that 2x (as an example of order of magnitude) is in turn too much :!
[03-31-2006 12:10:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> thats harder ;)
[03-31-2006 12:10:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> i hate writing estimates
[03-31-2006 12:10:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> it also depends whether you want to keep them as customer
[03-31-2006 12:20:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i hear you
[03-31-2006 12:20:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> in this case i want to bring them on as a customer for development and support ...aka do more than just the upgrade they contacted me about this week :\
[03-31-2006 12:21:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok then keep pricing reasonable
[03-31-2006 12:21:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[03-31-2006 12:21:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, hense my 4-7 hour estimate
[03-31-2006 12:22:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[03-31-2006 12:22:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> half a day sounds right in that case
[03-31-2006 12:22:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but i'll have to bump it up a little (time) to cover more of the incidentals that seem to creap in a project ;)
[03-31-2006 12:24:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> great advice guys, manny thanks all around
[03-31-2006 13:12:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh joy
[03-31-2006 13:12:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> i have the cache deactivated in my template
[03-31-2006 13:12:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> first time i load a node after cache clearing everything works
[03-31-2006 13:12:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> if i hit reload, it doesnt show me any of my stuff anymore
