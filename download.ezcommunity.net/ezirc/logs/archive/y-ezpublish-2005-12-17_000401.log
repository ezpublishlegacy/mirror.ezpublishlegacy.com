[12-15-2005 02:50:30] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> no, it will use drupal :)
[12-15-2005 02:50:34] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> not..
[12-15-2005 02:50:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> now i'm confused
[12-15-2005 02:50:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> two negations are too much ;)
[12-15-2005 03:03:03] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> haha
[12-15-2005 03:10:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> especialy if they are in different lines ;)
[12-15-2005 03:11:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> the most natural solution would obviously be http://planetplanet.org/
[12-15-2005 03:18:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> but sticking to eating your own dog food would suggest ez ;)
[12-15-2005 03:18:37] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> yuck.. dog food
[12-15-2005 03:18:48] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> I tried eating our dogs dry food
[12-15-2005 03:18:56] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> can't understand how the dog likes that
[12-15-2005 03:19:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-15-2005 03:19:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> i once tried cat food
[12-15-2005 03:19:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> even the smell is disgusting
[12-15-2005 03:19:34] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> strange animals
[12-15-2005 03:22:09] [#ezpublish] <@ordnas> buz: yes, on eZ
[12-15-2005 03:22:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> cool
[12-15-2005 03:23:54] [#ezpublish] <@ordnas> the dog food at least got nicely wrapped for Planet eZ :)
[12-15-2005 03:36:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> http://us.gizmodo.com/gadgets/smartphones/wzero3-smartphone-143048.php that is sooo what i want (minus windows)

[12-15-2005 03:44:35] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hi!
[12-15-2005 03:46:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> damn the old syntax is really really ugly
[12-15-2005 03:47:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-15-2005 03:47:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> the new one is a big improvement
[12-15-2005 03:47:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah
[12-15-2005 03:47:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's almost usable :)
[12-15-2005 03:47:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm still missing operators such as == though
[12-15-2005 03:48:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm sure we'll have them one day
[12-15-2005 03:49:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hmmm now how am i gonna customize the meta description just for one content class and its children...
[12-15-2005 03:50:26] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> guys, I have a question about cache which I think belies some big misunderstanding of how cache works. anyone willing to do some guesswork/answering?
[12-15-2005 03:50:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm willing to give it a try
[12-15-2005 03:50:45] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the misunderstanding of cuorse is mine ;)
[12-15-2005 03:50:50] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok ...
[12-15-2005 03:51:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> Katana`: node overrides? different classes?
[12-15-2005 03:51:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> Sulfur: shoot
[12-15-2005 03:52:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> meta desc is shown in page_head.tpl , included from pagelayout
[12-15-2005 03:52:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no overrides here :)
[12-15-2005 03:52:32] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I use , as cache switches, templatecache, viewcaching, templatecompile
[12-15-2005 03:52:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> you can override anything i think
[12-15-2005 03:52:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe not as comfortably on a per node basis
[12-15-2005 03:52:48] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> my site works perfectly when those are off
[12-15-2005 03:53:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> templatecompile and templatecache should always work
[12-15-2005 03:53:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> viewcaching is usually where the fun ensues
[12-15-2005 03:53:16] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> on it I have 3 pages, especially homepage ( see http://www.ioscelgo.it ) which have a buggy behavior when caches are on
[12-15-2005 03:53:30] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the buggy part is the poll part
[12-15-2005 03:53:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> its behavior is like this (it is NOT eZ 's poll module)
[12-15-2005 03:54:17] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> if an user has'nt voted, he will see the radiobuttons
[12-15-2005 03:54:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> when he votes, its vote will be recorded on a cookie, and if he is a registered user, also on DB
[12-15-2005 03:54:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> sorry
[12-15-2005 03:54:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the fact that he has voted!
[12-15-2005 03:55:02] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> not the vote
[12-15-2005 03:55:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> to do that, I have written a custom operator
[12-15-2005 03:55:31] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> which checks in cookies and db if he did vote.
[12-15-2005 03:55:36] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> following me so far ?
[12-15-2005 03:56:13] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> you may try it if you want :)
[12-15-2005 03:56:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the trouble is, when I turn on caching, this mechanism will no longer work
[12-15-2005 03:56:53] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> and every user - also those who haven't voted - will see the results and will be unable to vote
[12-15-2005 03:57:10] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I had a similar problem (which I still have to resolve) when using paginator
[12-15-2005 03:59:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but buz: you don't have every override condition on every template
[12-15-2005 03:59:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i can't override page_head.tpl based on override conditions of node/view/*.tpl
[12-15-2005 03:59:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> or can I ?
[12-15-2005 03:59:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> i guess that makes some sense
[12-15-2005 04:00:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> maybe I can actually :)
[12-15-2005 04:00:06] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> what's your problem Katana`?
[12-15-2005 04:00:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> we exchange expertise ;)
[12-15-2005 04:00:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> Sulfur: google for cache-block and cache_ttl
[12-15-2005 04:00:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> oh I do something similar already
[12-15-2005 04:01:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> override Source=navigation/rightmenu.tpl Match[section]=13
[12-15-2005 04:01:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and it works
[12-15-2005 04:02:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> buz: I did cache-block based on user and uri and the only result I had is to have it even more broken
[12-15-2005 04:04:38] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> maybe it's becasue I don't understand well what each switch does
[12-15-2005 04:04:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> it's like the conditions and tpl operators were computed once and for all
[12-15-2005 04:11:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> so any ideas ?
[12-15-2005 04:14:39] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i don't get the node id with this script :

[12-15-2005 04:19:40] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> now it's ok :)
[12-15-2005 04:19:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> proper setter, getters would be cleaner than attribute
[12-15-2005 04:20:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> probably
[12-15-2005 04:20:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> but likely not feasible in php4
[12-15-2005 04:20:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> attribute is still cool :)
[12-15-2005 04:20:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Sulfur, i miss banatage :\
[12-15-2005 04:20:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> (as i dont think you can create classes on the fly in 4, not sure about 5)
[12-15-2005 04:21:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> banatage ?
[12-15-2005 04:22:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you can using eval
[12-15-2005 04:22:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> iptv show that never got past -3 episodes :\
[12-15-2005 04:22:50] [#ezpublish] <kracker> about gaming :\ funy characters those guys
[12-15-2005 04:23:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> BOOM HEADSHOT
[12-15-2005 04:23:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok but eval is far from being a sane interface to create classes
[12-15-2005 04:23:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's the only way to create a class so far buz
[12-15-2005 04:23:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i think there is an override extension for php4
[12-15-2005 04:23:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> overload

[12-15-2005 04:23:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually, you can use require('somedynamicfile') as an even worse hack ;)

[12-15-2005 04:59:37] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i need to save data from a datatype to data_text
[12-15-2005 05:00:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> DiGiTa|_: you can use the xml-block datatype to store xml
[12-15-2005 05:00:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> no you cant
[12-15-2005 05:00:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> you can use it to store ezxml
[12-15-2005 05:00:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> which is a very small subset of xml
[12-15-2005 05:01:27] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> buz: witch ezxml u mean the tags that can be used for formatting content.
[12-15-2005 05:01:57] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ok i will try with ezxml
[12-15-2005 05:02:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-15-2005 05:02:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the class is very good
[12-15-2005 05:02:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> which are the ONLY tags allowed
[12-15-2005 05:02:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so i would say it depends on the structure what DiGiTa|_ want to be stored.
[12-15-2005 05:02:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-15-2005 05:02:36] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> not complicated
[12-15-2005 05:03:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> its rather depends on the tags you want to use. or better said the namespace.
[12-15-2005 05:03:43] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> like image tags
[12-15-2005 05:03:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> unfortunately you have no xml-namespace support within eZ.
[12-15-2005 05:03:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> ezimage
[12-15-2005 05:03:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> huh?
[12-15-2005 05:03:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> store images inside xml?
[12-15-2005 05:04:04] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> no
[12-15-2005 05:04:10] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> data like ezimage daatype
[12-15-2005 05:04:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> metadata for images?
[12-15-2005 05:04:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ah.
[12-15-2005 05:04:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> ezxml isnt particularly well suited for that
[12-15-2005 05:04:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so u have the ez-intern namespace used in packages.

[12-15-2005 05:05:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah that one is quite good
[12-15-2005 05:05:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> (quite contrary to ezxmltext itself)
[12-15-2005 05:05:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> one of the best PHP4 XML parser / generator i've seen around
[12-15-2005 05:05:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> whats the difference to the common phpdom api?
[12-15-2005 05:05:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> more oo
[12-15-2005 05:06:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> more powerful, easier to use, oo
[12-15-2005 05:06:09] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ok ;)
[12-15-2005 05:06:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think it's necessarily more powerfol than domxml
[12-15-2005 05:06:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well probably not more powerful
[12-15-2005 05:06:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> domxml exposes more features than ezdom
[12-15-2005 05:06:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> much more user friendly
[12-15-2005 05:06:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> but definitely saner api
[12-15-2005 05:06:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> i still think it should expose schema validation if php supports it
[12-15-2005 05:07:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> apropos ezxml, will we see that new OE4 parser open sourced?
[12-15-2005 05:08:07] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> buz: wait and see.....
[12-15-2005 05:10:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> buz i would like to see regular-grammar-based validation like wich RELAX NG.
[12-15-2005 05:10:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-15-2005 05:10:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> schema is a WEIRD beast
[12-15-2005 05:10:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> relax ng is much saner to use
[12-15-2005 05:11:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> i THINK domxml can do relaxng
[12-15-2005 05:11:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's just that it's errors are pretty useless
[12-15-2005 05:11:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> buz | >it's just that it's errors are pretty useless <- what u mean?
[12-15-2005 05:11:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> well it gives out errors
[12-15-2005 05:12:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> (in some cases) but nowhere near human readable
[12-15-2005 05:12:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> ideally i'd want an error like "XY is not allowed as child of Z"
[12-15-2005 05:13:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i thought exactly this is possible with it.
[12-15-2005 05:13:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> well it does give out something
[12-15-2005 05:13:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> but nothing a user would understand
[12-15-2005 05:14:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> it depends what rules u define for validation.
[12-15-2005 05:14:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> xml validated xml.
[12-15-2005 05:14:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> s/validated/validates/
[12-15-2005 05:14:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> well i think i was using the w3c xhtml transitional schema
[12-15-2005 05:14:55] [#ezpublish] * Katana` is unsure of how multiline text is to be handled by i18n...
[12-15-2005 05:14:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> not relax ng
[12-15-2005 05:15:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ezlinguist handles it but you don't have something like nl2br ...
[12-15-2005 05:15:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> dont use multiline text
[12-15-2005 05:15:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ...
[12-15-2005 05:15:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> let the browser handle it
[12-15-2005 05:15:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> thanks for that amazing contribution, problem solved
[12-15-2005 05:15:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah, <br /> is totally not standard and should never be used
[12-15-2005 05:15:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana`: what contrib?
[12-15-2005 05:15:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ...
[12-15-2005 05:16:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it was a bloody sarcasm
[12-15-2005 05:16:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i am dumb, so no wonder ;)
[12-15-2005 05:16:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ok, |nl2br does the job
[12-15-2005 05:17:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> doh.
[12-15-2005 05:19:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> buz: i had a look on schematron?
[12-15-2005 05:32:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> oops s/i/u/ ;)
[12-15-2005 05:50:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> was out for lunch
[12-15-2005 05:53:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh there's schematron for php http://phpxmlclasses.sourceforge.net/show_doc.php?class=class_schematron.html
[12-15-2005 05:53:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> but it needs stinking sablotron
[12-15-2005 05:54:41] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[12-15-2005 05:54:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> is there a schematron schema for XHTML1.0?
[12-15-2005 05:55:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well .. i dont know. sorry.
[12-15-2005 05:55:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> exactly this i want to have when ez checks if an content-xml-text is valid ;)
[12-15-2005 05:56:10] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +is
[12-15-2005 05:56:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> YEAH ez rss feeds
[12-15-2005 05:58:41] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> btw ... how i could process a submitted form which is a value of an contentObjectAttribute, when this attribute is displayed on the page?
[12-15-2005 06:00:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> lock at attribute_view_edit gui
[12-15-2005 06:01:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure if it works without editing it first
[12-15-2005 06:01:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> but maybe
[12-15-2005 06:01:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> buz: its no problem to display the form but how to process the submit of the form?
[12-15-2005 06:02:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh
[12-15-2005 06:02:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think you just need to post it to the right url?
[12-15-2005 06:03:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> try the url that's being used in the edit template
[12-15-2005 06:04:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> buz ;) uhm
[12-15-2005 06:05:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> problem being the fact that only drafts can be edited i guess
[12-15-2005 06:06:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> try asking on the forum
[12-15-2005 06:06:45] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> thanks buz.
[12-15-2005 06:07:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> sometimes a solution is so near and you dont get it anyway.
[12-15-2005 06:07:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> it could certainly be done with an extension ;)

[12-15-2005 13:45:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> my advanced forum stuff is all extension
[12-15-2005 13:45:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nice :)
[12-15-2005 13:52:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's not really that hard
[12-15-2005 13:52:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> just painful because you dont get any gui support
[12-15-2005 13:52:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> GUI for ?
[12-15-2005 13:52:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> oh
[12-15-2005 13:52:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah
[12-15-2005 13:52:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> creation of overrides
[12-15-2005 13:52:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> since i don't use those...
[12-15-2005 13:52:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> i like it
[12-15-2005 13:52:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's foolproof
[12-15-2005 13:52:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but i'm sure we could find a way to make it work here :)
[12-15-2005 13:53:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> with some templating and a custom module i'm sure it'd work
[12-15-2005 13:53:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> a better INTERFACE would be more important to me
[12-15-2005 13:53:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> like for FINDING tempaltes ;=
[12-15-2005 13:53:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hehehe
[12-15-2005 13:53:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> debug does that pretty well imho
[12-15-2005 13:53:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> usually edit them in quanta anyway
[12-15-2005 13:53:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i always find & edit stuff in my IDE
[12-15-2005 13:53:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> tho the syntax coloring only works right with the old language
[12-15-2005 13:54:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> gotta fix that
[12-15-2005 13:54:13] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-15-2005 13:54:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's pretty good in PHPEdit, and I even have code hint / insight for ez syntax
[12-15-2005 13:54:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> as well as contextual help
[12-15-2005 13:54:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok that's neat
[12-15-2005 13:54:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> now if it would work on linux natively...
[12-15-2005 13:55:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we do have more plans ;)
[12-15-2005 13:55:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we really hope it will in the future
[12-15-2005 13:55:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but probably not before a year
[12-15-2005 13:56:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i have suggested that feature yesterday...
[12-15-2005 13:56:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> http://issues.waterproof.fr/IssueView.php?Id=4194&activeItem=1
[12-15-2005 13:56:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> there are a few nice ones
[12-15-2005 14:00:24] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> buz: we also use extensions for all the customer projects
[12-15-2005 14:03:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> there's no copyright on the concept right kris10an ? :)
[12-15-2005 14:04:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> patent probably
[12-15-2005 14:05:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> something like the 1click patent
[12-15-2005 14:05:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> (i know is houldnt shop amazon, but they are cheaper than the others ;)
[12-15-2005 14:06:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> wh not ??
[12-15-2005 14:07:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> evil company
[12-15-2005 14:07:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> with lots of evil patents
[12-15-2005 14:08:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i like them :)
[12-15-2005 14:08:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> hey at least i dont buy any sony stuff anymore
[12-15-2005 14:08:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> they're serious, fast, and have everything
[12-15-2005 14:08:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> not so fast here
[12-15-2005 14:08:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> stuff comes from germany
[12-15-2005 14:08:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i just get books or DVD from them
[12-15-2005 14:08:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah me too
[12-15-2005 14:08:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> on .fr and .co.uk
[12-15-2005 14:08:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> co.uk has rip off shipping to switzerland
[12-15-2005 14:08:49] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> offcourse we have an evil patent on that :-s
[12-15-2005 14:09:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> okay ^^
[12-15-2005 14:09:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no article it is then so much for the community ^^
[12-15-2005 14:09:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> writing about patents is ok
[12-15-2005 14:09:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> implementing the stuff isnt ;)
[12-15-2005 14:11:06] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no.. we let you patent it buz..
[12-15-2005 14:11:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> no softpats in CH
[12-15-2005 14:11:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> thank god
[12-15-2005 14:11:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> oh, okay ;)
[12-15-2005 14:12:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no patents there either afaik
[12-15-2005 14:12:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm gonna buy a gun if they ever accept those here
[12-15-2005 14:12:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> a BIG one
[12-15-2005 14:12:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> (giant guns are more easily obtained here than small ones)
[12-15-2005 14:13:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> harder to hide ;)
[12-15-2005 14:15:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> exactly
[12-15-2005 14:15:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> that is the legal reason for it even
[12-15-2005 14:15:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> but even pistols and the like can be bought without muc htrouble
[12-15-2005 14:16:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-15-2005 14:16:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69817,00.html now what could i do with THAT
[12-15-2005 14:16:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> finally, i CAN download the internet muahaha
[12-15-2005 14:17:27] [#ezpublish] * Katana` wants a 10K RPM SATA disk
[12-15-2005 14:17:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont

[12-15-2005 16:09:47] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> oooooh
[12-15-2005 16:09:50] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> TIE SLAPPING
[12-15-2005 16:09:55] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> now that has been a long time
[12-15-2005 16:10:13] [#ezpublish] * @fh[eZ] dips his tie in the beer he got at the student house
[12-15-2005 16:10:20] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> ............ SLAP

[12-15-2005 16:11:39] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> SLAP!
[12-15-2005 16:12:01] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> (elephant ties hurt much more, cause of the weight)
[12-15-2005 16:12:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> re
[12-15-2005 16:13:19] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> damn.. can't beat that
[12-15-2005 16:13:49] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> I can use my curling tie... that should be quite nice as well
[12-15-2005 16:14:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> whats wrong with this: {section show = ( and( true(),'form'|compare( $ContentObjectAttribute:item.contentclass_attribute.name ) ) }
[12-15-2005 16:14:39] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> try to remove the spaces
[12-15-2005 16:14:48] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> {section show=(
[12-15-2005 16:14:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ah, lets try.
[12-15-2005 16:16:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hmm, no success: {section show=(and(true(),'form'|compare( $ContentObjectAttribute:item.contentclass_attribute.name))}
[12-15-2005 16:17:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> otherwise, how else would u test two string for equality?
[12-15-2005 16:18:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ah, i see another space. second try!
[12-15-2005 16:19:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hm, still no success.
[12-15-2005 16:25:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> even this fails: {section show=('form'|compare('form')}
[12-15-2005 16:28:51] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this is better: {section show='form'|compare('form'}
[12-15-2005 16:28:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ;)
