[03-27-2006 03:59:37] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hi all
[03-27-2006 03:59:52] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> just a quick question about the search engine of ezPublish ... where does it exactly search ? :)
[03-27-2006 04:00:18] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> one of our customer wants a description of the capabilities of the search engine
[03-27-2006 04:00:43] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so we should answer him like (to summarize): in the db, in the templates, ...
[03-27-2006 04:01:05] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> is there any page explaining this on the ez.no site? (didn't find any, on my side :-/ )
[03-27-2006 04:03:54] [#ezpublish] <_kore> You mark attributes of contentobjects searchable, they will be indexed, and then you can search them
[03-27-2006 04:04:37] [#ezpublish] <_kore> http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_6/features/search_engine
[03-27-2006 04:07:44] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so, if by any "chance", it appears to exist some "content" directly inside a template for instance, then it's not searched at all ?
[03-27-2006 04:08:07] [#ezpublish] <_kore> There shouldn't be any content in templates ;)
[03-27-2006 04:08:16] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yep, that's what I answered as well :D
[03-27-2006 04:08:37] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> and about PDF files ?
[03-27-2006 04:08:52] [#ezpublish] <_kore> ezPublish has a static cache, so there is really no reason for content in templates
[03-27-2006 04:08:53] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> or content uploaded
[03-27-2006 04:09:19] [#ezpublish] <_kore> I don't really know, but I remember it is indexed, too
[03-27-2006 04:09:29] [#ezpublish] * _kore pokes kris10an 
[03-27-2006 04:10:16] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> "The search engine don't search inside files .pdf. Is this behavior a normal one ?
[03-27-2006 04:10:16] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> Thanks you.
[03-27-2006 04:10:19] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> ;)
[03-27-2006 04:10:32] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> it was the first (and only one) comment at the bottom of the search engine page :)

[03-27-2006 10:55:13] [#ezpublish] <_buz> katana`: maybe we should go steal designs from http://www.oswd.org/
[03-27-2006 11:19:09] [#ezpublish] <xbit_> open source web desigaha
[03-27-2006 11:19:29] [#ezpublish] <_buz> could be useful for the design challenged like myself
[03-27-2006 11:20:45] [#ezpublish] <xbit_> i wonder how many of those images are copyrighted...
[03-27-2006 11:20:52] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah that's the question
[03-27-2006 11:20:56] [#ezpublish] <_buz> then again
[03-27-2006 11:21:03] [#ezpublish] <_buz> images are there for replacement
[03-27-2006 11:21:45] [#ezpublish] <xbit_> yep
[03-27-2006 11:22:36] [#ezpublish] <xbit_> it's kinda weird to call it open source though, since all webpages are inheritely "open source"
[03-27-2006 11:22:46] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah well you are supposed to steal
[03-27-2006 11:22:51] [#ezpublish] <_buz> as opposed to you can steal ;)
[03-27-2006 11:23:28] [#ezpublish] <xbit_> yeah :)

[03-27-2006 14:46:20] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I am going to write an extension in order to provide a new datatype for attributes but I don't want to reinvent the wheel so I ask for suggestions. I need a multi-field datatype (like "Author", that has "Name", "Mail") with arbitrary cardinality (like "Author", where you can specify "Add author" and add how may authors you need). I may call my new datatype "TextWithImageAndMovie" because an attribute of such type must be a collectio

[03-27-2006 16:51:47] [#ezpublish] <kracker> great
[03-27-2006 16:52:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i didn't quite gather what the end result would provide :\ maybee that's just me
[03-27-2006 16:54:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> a multi attribute datatype ... to define multiple objects per datatype ... genericly (to meet your needs) or just the end result of TextWithImageAndMovie ...
[03-27-2006 16:55:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, the name kinda reminds me of a tv show in the states ... dinner and a movie ;)
[03-27-2006 16:56:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> doesn't seem to complicated though :) the end results are fairly straight forward
