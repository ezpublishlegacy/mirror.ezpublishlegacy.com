[04-20-2006 04:31:31] [#ezpublish] <phretor> hi there
[04-20-2006 04:40:19] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi phretor
[04-20-2006 04:41:01] [#ezpublish] <phretor> can someone explain me why the same codeline takes 46sec to complete on a dual Xeon with 2G of RAM and 15sec on my poor powerbook?
[04-20-2006 04:41:35] [#ezpublish] <phretor> both have php4.4.2/64M/60sec but the powerbook have apache1 while the dual Xeon uses apache2
[04-20-2006 04:44:12] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> no idea
[04-20-2006 04:55:41] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kalooni: where should I have a look at?
[04-20-2006 04:56:43] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> APACHE<->PHP config (CGI or module ?)
[04-20-2006 04:56:55] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kalooni: module
[04-20-2006 04:57:03] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> both ?
[04-20-2006 05:02:21] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kalooni: yes, both
[04-20-2006 05:02:46] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kalooni: the environment is slightly similar
[04-20-2006 05:03:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> except web server version ;)
[04-20-2006 05:03:42] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> and OS
[04-20-2006 05:04:28] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> sorry but I am not helpful at all in that field
[04-20-2006 05:04:46] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> btw there is few fields where I could be helpful
[04-20-2006 05:04:48] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kalooni: Debian GNU/Linux on the dual Xeon, that should perform better than Mac OS X (Panther) of the powerbook
[04-20-2006 05:05:26] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes clear, that should be
[04-20-2006 05:06:09] [#ezpublish] <phretor> Mac OS X is the most unefficient UNIX on the planet :-D
[04-20-2006 05:06:18] [#ezpublish] <phretor> but the most usable one, too
[04-20-2006 05:07:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> to my point of view the problem is coming from apache 2 ... have you tried to install apache1 on your PowerBook and do the comparison ?
[04-20-2006 05:08:07] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but as I said before I am not an expert
[04-20-2006 05:08:14] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but this is the kind of test I would do
