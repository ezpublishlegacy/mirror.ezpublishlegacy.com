[07-01-2006 07:31:59] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. Please be aware that there are still kiddies using the D C C exploit on freenode. If you've been knocked off freenode, or if you think you might be using a vulnerable router, please connect to the network using port 8001, rather than 6667 (the default).
[07-01-2006 07:32:39] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Apologies for the inconvenience, and thank you for using freenode.
