[05-30-2006 06:18:48] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> hi
[05-30-2006 06:33:29] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> aloha
[05-30-2006 06:38:58] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> hi friends, good day, b-killer do you know an advanced tutorial to do a real world web with EZP? I see SITEPOINT but they seem of older versiones
[05-30-2006 06:44:46] -!- awormus [n=aaron@p54B121E0.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has quit ["Leaving"]
[05-30-2006 06:53:24] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> I searching a solution to set a field untranslatable after adding some products
[05-30-2006 06:53:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> if someone has an idea
[05-30-2006 06:54:05] [#ezpublish] <zr1> marking in class editor deletes content?
[05-30-2006 06:54:24] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> no it just do anything
[05-30-2006 06:54:48] [#ezpublish] <zr1> strange
[05-30-2006 06:54:50] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> if i change the price after marking the field, the price stay the same as the old one
[05-30-2006 06:55:04] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> in translated version
[05-30-2006 06:56:22] [#ezpublish] <zr1> i guess you have to find translations and delete them, apparently the flag only works when creating new object, not when reading from one
[05-30-2006 06:56:38] [#ezpublish] <zr1> and I'd say its a bug, be sure to file it
[05-30-2006 06:57:29] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes it's what i'm thinking, but if i remove the translation in the db, then my class is corrupt
[05-30-2006 06:58:14] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i've tried to totally remove the field and create a new one
[05-30-2006 06:58:27] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> but it doesn't work
[05-30-2006 06:58:29] [#ezpublish] <zr1> just a idea: after you have flagged it, go change price. then look in db for unchanged prices
[05-30-2006 06:58:56] [#ezpublish] <zr1> should work if you change field id.. ?
[05-30-2006 06:59:10] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> no...
[05-30-2006 06:59:17] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i try
[05-30-2006 06:59:57] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it's like if  the full class have settings somewhere
[05-30-2006 07:00:16] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> with those flags
[05-30-2006 07:00:57] [#ezpublish] <zr1> look at the db map and figure out what branches are orphaned by disabling translation
[05-30-2006 07:01:24] [#ezpublish] <zr1> i hope you have BIG monitor :P
[05-30-2006 07:01:30] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> remind me the DB map url please
[05-30-2006 07:01:31] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :)
[05-30-2006 07:03:12] [#ezpublish] <zr1> search for "database diagram"
[05-30-2006 07:06:31] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> theres only the field "can_translate" in ezcontentclass_attribute
[05-30-2006 07:06:39] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> strange :/
[05-30-2006 07:08:38] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> shit hsit shit
