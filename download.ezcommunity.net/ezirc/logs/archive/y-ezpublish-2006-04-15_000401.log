[04-13-2006 12:03:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> (19:54:11) zrg: hi folks, is it possible to import content package from local disk, not over browser?  (19:56:51) zrg: have a 200mb package, hard to upload via browser.. ideas?
[04-13-2006 12:04:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> somehow that works yes
[04-13-2006 12:04:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> look just where the packages that ship with ez  live
[04-13-2006 12:04:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> and try putting yours there maybe?
[04-13-2006 12:04:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> there is also ezpm for the cli
[04-13-2006 12:04:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> since i doubt that youll be able to get a 200mb file through php anyway
[04-13-2006 12:06:05] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it was able to create it, should be able to import, no?
[04-13-2006 12:06:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> not necessarily
[04-13-2006 12:06:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> well given high enough constraints it likely would
[04-13-2006 12:08:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> dang.. probably have to try update old site then, more work but at least i know it will work
[04-13-2006 12:08:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> but do look into ezpm
[04-13-2006 12:08:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's cli and thus much easier to get to work
[04-13-2006 12:08:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> no apache weirdness
[04-13-2006 12:12:33] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, thanks a lot for tip :)
[04-13-2006 12:14:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> so it works?
[04-13-2006 12:15:39] [#ezpublish] <zrg> dont know yet :)
