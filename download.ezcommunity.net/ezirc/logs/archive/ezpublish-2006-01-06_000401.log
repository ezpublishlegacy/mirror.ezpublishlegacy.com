[01-05-2006 03:21:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> morning everybody ... :)
[01-05-2006 03:23:26] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> good morning Sulfur ;)
[01-05-2006 03:23:39] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hi  SEAwolfx
[01-05-2006 03:25:38] [#ezpublish] * Sulfur is facing a tricky cache - related design problem .. hum :)
[01-05-2006 03:25:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> maybe I'll post this to the forums
[01-05-2006 03:27:55] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> (damn those who don't heed the developer's advice ;) )
[01-05-2006 03:42:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> eZ crew ( fh[eZ] , hovik, kris10an ) and seasoned eZ programmers, I invite you to spend your .02â‚¬ on this: http://ez.no/community/forum/developer/interesting_i_think_design_issue_regarding_caches :)
[01-05-2006 03:44:58] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> Sulfur: yep, aware of this.. the smart view cache needs to get more rules to support all the cases properly
[01-05-2006 03:45:46] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> but it quickly leads you to a place where you would have to write PHP code to do proper cache clearing
[01-05-2006 03:46:45] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> or that you have to clear the cache of the fetching page every time content is posted on your site
[01-05-2006 03:46:50] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> fh[eZ]: were it for me, in that case I'd go for the custom workflow, if applicable. but anyway, is there a way , with current ez version, to get me out of this situation ?
[01-05-2006 03:47:06] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes, you mean clear all caches, right ?
[01-05-2006 03:47:31] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> no, not all caches, just for the pages where you do the fetch based on the keywords
[01-05-2006 03:47:54] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> you could do that with a workflow...
[01-05-2006 03:48:19] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> you could also use a cacheblock on these pages if it is not important that the new content is visible right away
[01-05-2006 03:48:24] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> like five minutes for example
[01-05-2006 03:49:05] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> how can I clear caches using a workflow ?
[01-05-2006 03:49:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> or fh[eZ] , would you mind to put your answer in the thread? so everyone will benefit from it
[01-05-2006 03:50:08] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> I
[01-05-2006 03:50:10] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> adsf
[01-05-2006 03:50:18] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> I'll try to remember.. quite busy at the moment
[01-05-2006 03:52:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok ... I'll be your autoreminder :P

[01-05-2006 08:36:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hey guys, I am at a slight loss. what was that ini setting that made the names of the used templates appear within your page, in addition to be listed on the debug zone? I want to turn it off :)
[01-05-2006 08:39:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> no problem, found it
[01-05-2006 08:40:51] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> check box wich appear when debug = on help a lot :)
[01-05-2006 08:43:29] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> mmm yes you are right, I notice it now .... I am so used to editing the conf files by myself that I filter that zone out
[01-05-2006 08:54:48] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i've got a little problem: i'm using <embed href='ezobject://101' size='small' align='left' /> for display a picture
[01-05-2006 08:54:51] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> but then i have errors :
[01-05-2006 08:54:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> No such attribute for array(5): classification
[01-05-2006 08:54:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> Choose one of following: href, class, target, title, id
[01-05-2006 08:55:05] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> any idea ?
[01-05-2006 08:55:13] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> (the picture is correctly displayed)
[01-05-2006 08:56:50] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> (i have 8 errors for 4 pictures)
