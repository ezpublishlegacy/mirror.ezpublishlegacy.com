[11-30-2005 02:30:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hi kore :)
[11-30-2005 02:34:23] [#ezpublish] <hovik> hi
[11-30-2005 02:35:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> may I ask you a question hovik ? I seem you are the person I need
[11-30-2005 02:35:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it seems...
[11-30-2005 02:35:53] [#ezpublish] <hovik> go ahead
[11-30-2005 02:36:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what would you do if you were asked to implement content staging, in a setup where you have a dev server (cms only, not used by visitors) and a public server (public site only, cms is not used) ?
[11-30-2005 02:36:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hang yourself ?
[11-30-2005 02:37:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> basically, our client wants to have a "button" he can click in order to have object X published to public server
[11-30-2005 02:37:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i saw that you were directing those who wanted staging to packages, but I'm not really sure in that situation... suggestions ?
[11-30-2005 02:38:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> (if it was you i'm not actually sure ^^)
[11-30-2005 02:39:31] [#ezpublish] <hovik> Do you only want to stage content, or other types of settings as well ? ( design, settings, etc )
[11-30-2005 02:40:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> only content, they won't be using anything else
[11-30-2005 02:40:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we'll figure out by hand for the rest ;)
[11-30-2005 02:41:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> (by the way there are 2 public servers but they're using a MySQL cluster...
[11-30-2005 02:42:03] [#ezpublish] <hovik> You can almost use the content packages for this. There are however 2 problems.
[11-30-2005 02:42:13] [#ezpublish] <hovik> Not all datatypes are supported.
[11-30-2005 02:42:58] [#ezpublish] <hovik> When resending the same object in a package, you'll get a copy of the object in the destination server, not a new version.
[11-30-2005 02:43:21] [#ezpublish] <hovik> This is something we've been wanting to fix for a long time, but have not had the resources.
[11-30-2005 02:43:49] [#ezpublish] <hovik> There is also a problem when exporting f.eks 1000 objects, as the packages does not scale very well.
[11-30-2005 02:45:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> 1000 objects wouldn't happen I think
[11-30-2005 02:45:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> I had thought about the resending an object, and this IS gonna occur
[11-30-2005 02:45:30] [#ezpublish] <hovik> We could fix these things if you asked for it on support though.
[11-30-2005 02:45:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm gonna :)
[11-30-2005 02:46:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i won't have time to finish that before i leave
[11-30-2005 02:46:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> email support ?
[11-30-2005 02:49:37] [#ezpublish] <hovik> http://ez.no/services/support
[11-30-2005 02:50:28] [#ezpublish] <hovik> but send an email to : support@ez.no , with some description of what you want to do, and we'll can give an estimate for it.
[11-30-2005 02:51:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> okay great
[11-30-2005 02:51:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we still have some support credit :)

[11-30-2005 04:10:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> who ?
[11-30-2005 04:12:53] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> Peer
[11-30-2005 04:13:06] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> Peer Gynt is a character in a play
[11-30-2005 04:16:05] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> never heard of Ibsen?
[11-30-2005 04:16:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope
[11-30-2005 04:16:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nada
[11-30-2005 04:18:13] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> Henrik Ibsen was one of the great writers in Norwegian litterature (or so they say *sigh*), and he should be well known all over the world
[11-30-2005 04:18:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well...
[11-30-2005 04:18:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> my culture is limited ;)
[11-30-2005 04:21:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> never heard of him
[11-30-2005 04:21:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> i only now about the opera
[11-30-2005 04:21:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> (or whatever the music for peer gynt comes from)
[11-30-2005 04:22:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> "the dawn" from peer gynt is actually a very popular classical piece
[11-30-2005 04:28:21] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> ah, that must be "Morgenstemning"
[11-30-2005 04:28:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah (considering what morgenstimmung in german means)
[11-30-2005 04:28:49] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> composed by Edvard Grieg
[11-30-2005 04:28:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> exactly
[11-30-2005 04:30:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> classical music lends itself to coding i've found
[11-30-2005 04:34:13] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> how's that you figure?
[11-30-2005 04:43:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> unlike metal it's generally not as aggressive
[11-30-2005 04:44:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> hiphop i cant stand
[11-30-2005 04:44:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> and lack of vocals help with concentration
[11-30-2005 04:45:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> trip hop is good for working

[11-30-2005 14:45:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> evening
[11-30-2005 14:45:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> my main PC died :(
[11-30-2005 14:45:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> main HD out of order...
[11-30-2005 14:46:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> thats what you have raid
[11-30-2005 14:46:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> why
[11-30-2005 14:46:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> i had a lot of machines dying on me this year
[11-30-2005 14:46:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> until i went and bought a new one ;)
[11-30-2005 14:47:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> you do have backups right?
[11-30-2005 15:00:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> anybody know anything about hifi speaker?
[11-30-2005 15:00:38] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> I do.
[11-30-2005 15:00:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> what to buy in the <300? range
[11-30-2005 15:01:03] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> what currency is that?
[11-30-2005 15:01:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> EURO
[11-30-2005 15:01:12] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> I only know norwegian prices
[11-30-2005 15:01:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> anything reasonably cheap you can recommend?
[11-30-2005 15:01:50] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> well if you want something cheap but descent I would recomend Dali.
[11-30-2005 15:02:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> doesnt look like such are being sold in switzerland
[11-30-2005 15:03:25] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> oh... well.
[11-30-2005 15:03:42] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> B&W is nice. dont know what they cost there
[11-30-2005 15:04:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> i got two of those already http://www.eltax.com/eltax/index.php?item=10&id=1831
[11-30-2005 15:04:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> might get another two
[11-30-2005 15:04:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> they sure provide nice bass
[11-30-2005 15:04:51] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> I dont know those
[11-30-2005 15:05:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> not very high quality
[11-30-2005 15:05:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> but 2*25cm woofers ;)
[11-30-2005 15:07:16] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> I have Bowers & Wilkins CM4
[11-30-2005 15:08:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> sounds like overkill to listen to mp3 ;)
[11-30-2005 15:09:40] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> hehe yeah
[11-30-2005 15:09:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> buz: what do you want to use those HP for ?
[11-30-2005 15:09:49] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> but if you find dali that is great value
[11-30-2005 15:10:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> HP?
[11-30-2005 15:12:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh i found dalis
[11-30-2005 15:12:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> pricey
[11-30-2005 15:13:23] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> buz: 5005LE is suitable and in the right price.
[11-30-2005 15:13:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> can only get 6006
[11-30-2005 15:14:16] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> that is about 100 euros more
[11-30-2005 15:14:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> the 5005 is only 2way it seems
[11-30-2005 15:14:59] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> yes
[11-30-2005 15:15:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe i'll just get sennheiser headphones
[11-30-2005 15:15:49] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> but find the 5005LE
[11-30-2005 15:15:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> but that doesnt let you fell the bass
[11-30-2005 15:15:56] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> it is a lot better than the normal 5005
[11-30-2005 15:15:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah i just found it
[11-30-2005 15:16:05] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> but at the same price
[11-30-2005 15:16:39] [#ezpublish] <Proteque> if bass is all you care about and soundquality doesnt matter you should go for cerwin vega :D
[11-30-2005 15:17:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont want a subwoofer ;)
[11-30-2005 15:17:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> besides the eltax monsters provide plenty of push
[11-30-2005 15:17:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> (they actually pump noticeable amounts of air out the bass reflex canal)
[11-30-2005 15:18:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> as home cinema setup, you can easily forgo any subwoofer with those ;)
[11-30-2005 15:32:39] [#ezpublish] * Katana` has Logitech Z-680 in the living room and they're amazing
[11-30-2005 15:33:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and they're just below EUR 300 :)
[11-30-2005 15:33:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, the new model, Z-5500
