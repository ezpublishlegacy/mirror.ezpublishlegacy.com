[01-04-2006 04:44:52] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it was a template syntax error

[01-04-2006 04:53:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> .oO( indeed, the eZDOM-Classmodel is convincing ;)
[01-04-2006 04:56:47] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> hi all :)
[01-04-2006 04:57:31] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i have created a custom datatype, then i added it to a class as non-translatable, and my problem is that it doesn't show when i'm on the english siteaccess
[01-04-2006 04:57:34] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i have pages which i want to remove from my main menu, is there any user flag ?
[01-04-2006 04:57:58] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> you can hide the nodes
[01-04-2006 04:58:15] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ah ?
[01-04-2006 04:58:26] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> look into admin
[01-04-2006 04:58:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> right click on icon
[01-04-2006 04:58:35] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> and hide node
[01-04-2006 04:59:13] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> yes but the content is hidden too :-/
[01-04-2006 04:59:33] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i want keep it visible everywhere but not in my main menu
[01-04-2006 05:00:10] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i just don't want this page name in the menu
[01-04-2006 05:00:13] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> you can create a custom class for this content
[01-04-2006 05:00:24] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> is there a user flag which i can set and then check with fetch function ?
[01-04-2006 05:00:39] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> or you can fetch hidden nodes
[01-04-2006 05:01:39] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> hmmm
[01-04-2006 05:01:42] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> fetch( 'content', 'list', hash( 'parent_node_id', $node.node_id, 'ignore_visibility',         ignore_visibility
[01-04-2006 05:01:52] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> should set to true or false
[01-04-2006 05:01:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i could create a MyFolder class and copy Folder. Then add a "Show in main menu" check box
[01-04-2006 05:02:27] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> oh
[01-04-2006 05:02:38] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes you can do like that
[01-04-2006 05:02:48] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> which seems cleaner to you ?
[01-04-2006 05:03:30] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> its sad ezpublish doesn't manage class inheritance yet :p
[01-04-2006 05:03:33] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> if you create a custom class it will not be visible into the menu
[01-04-2006 05:04:06] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> only if you specify this custom class into the menu.ini
[01-04-2006 05:04:47] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i build my menu by hand
[01-04-2006 05:05:02] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i think i'm not using menu.ini
[01-04-2006 05:05:10] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> bad :/
[01-04-2006 05:05:23] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> seems yes
[01-04-2006 05:05:34] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i'll read doc about how menu should be managed
[01-04-2006 05:06:02] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i just do fetching from root node and then <a href={$menu.url_alias|ezurl} class="menu">{$menu.object.name}</a>
[01-04-2006 05:07:22] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> you can do if ne(menu.node_id, id) .... {/if}
[01-04-2006 05:08:09] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> yes
[01-04-2006 05:08:19] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> but then its hardcoded ...
[01-04-2006 05:08:33] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> and publisher can't choose if an item should appear in menu or not
[01-04-2006 05:08:54] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> well, you can set those node id in a ini file
[01-04-2006 05:09:03] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> and read the ini
[01-04-2006 05:09:04] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> oh
[01-04-2006 05:09:10] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i didn't thought about that !
[01-04-2006 05:09:20] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> good idea :)
[01-04-2006 05:09:24] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> eheh
[01-04-2006 05:10:10] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i'll think about that. Now time for good eat =]. Thanks :)

[01-04-2006 13:35:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> hmm, why setting up webdav fails? hmm
[01-04-2006 13:35:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> re
[01-04-2006 13:44:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> webdav.log -> no valid site was found.. [CS:currentSitePath]
[01-04-2006 13:45:07] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> thats strange as the siteaccess is listed in the SiteList-Array in site.ini.append
[01-04-2006 13:49:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> hm, also the rewrite-rule seems to be correct.
[01-04-2006 13:54:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> hmm, when I add the admin siteaccess to the mentioned list i see it in the webdav browser. also i can authentificate to browse into it. but when i try to access on folder i get the previos error message.
[01-04-2006 13:55:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> is there any option to be set with in the backend to set the flag for webdav-use?
[01-04-2006 13:55:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> i guess not?!?!
[01-04-2006 14:01:51] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> like this: http://ez.no/community/forum/install_configuration/webdavenabled
[01-04-2006 14:12:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> hm ... there seems to be a bug in ./kernel/classes/webdav/ezwebdavcontentserver.php <- it assumes that the a SiteSetting-Section is located in webdav.ini which normaly is defined in the site.ini file
[01-04-2006 14:13:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> propably this section has to be defined twice. :/

[01-04-2006 15:06:20] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> how would I know?
[01-04-2006 15:06:51] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I can access it by webget so I know I can reach the site
[01-04-2006 15:06:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> xiglet: u could use echo or print to prove this?
[01-04-2006 15:07:19] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> change the rssimport.php script?
[01-04-2006 15:08:08] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> oh ... php -C cronjobs/rssimport.php did not work, however cd cronjobs && php -C rssimport.php gave me some output
[01-04-2006 15:08:34] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> xiglet | >change the rssimport.php script? <- yes
[01-04-2006 15:09:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> shouldnt scripts been run from the root?
[01-04-2006 15:09:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> ./bin/shell/..
[01-04-2006 15:13:47] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> it have to be run from root because the php script refers to kernel/xxx etc ...
[01-04-2006 15:14:06] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I can see that now :)
[01-04-2006 15:14:07] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> yeah.

[01-04-2006 15:42:50] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I have 3.6.4 on a debian sarge box with apache2 and php4 and runcronjobs works fine. That's not the case on my laptop with a 3.7.2 installation. That one is running kubuntu. What could be the issue? this is the error message:

[01-04-2006 15:43:15] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> but no debug info :(
[01-04-2006 15:43:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> because the request was ended
[01-04-2006 15:44:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> set up the execution time

[01-04-2006 15:44:57] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> and now you are thinking... "what are you doing here?" :)
[01-04-2006 15:45:00] [#ezpublish] <xbit> oh, you said ubuntu
[01-04-2006 15:45:05] [#ezpublish] <xbit> :)
[01-04-2006 15:45:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> :P
[01-04-2006 15:45:17] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> or kubuntu to be more correct
[01-04-2006 15:45:23] [#ezpublish] <xbit> mmh
[01-04-2006 15:45:29] [#ezpublish] <xbit> abolutely
[01-04-2006 15:45:35] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> best distro ever ;-)

[01-04-2006 15:45:53] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i prefer gnome :)
[01-04-2006 15:45:54] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I know where php.ini is :)
[01-04-2006 15:46:00] [#ezpublish] <xbit> good
[01-04-2006 15:46:03] [#ezpublish] <xbit> no problem then

[01-04-2006 15:46:17] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> oh
[01-04-2006 15:47:43] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> it sais 30 second, should be enough... it doesn't even run for more than 1 second
[01-04-2006 15:47:51] [#ezpublish] <xbit> not enough by far
[01-04-2006 15:47:56] [#ezpublish] <xbit> pull it up to 120 or so
[01-04-2006 15:47:59] [#ezpublish] <xbit> at least
[01-04-2006 15:48:06] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok
[01-04-2006 15:48:09] [#ezpublish] <xbit> it's just your laptop, no need to be restrictive :)
[01-04-2006 15:48:29] [#ezpublish] <xbit> pull up the memory-limit to above 100M while you're at it
[01-04-2006 15:48:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> .. it doesn't even run for more than 1 second <--- hmm :/
[01-04-2006 15:49:22] [#ezpublish] <xbit> hmm, what?
[01-04-2006 15:50:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> .. it doesn't even run for more than 1 second <- this might an indicator that setting up the max_exec_time does fit here
[01-04-2006 15:50:09] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> +be
[01-04-2006 15:50:38] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> 120 didn't make any different
[01-04-2006 15:50:40] [#ezpublish] <xbit> oh, didn't notice he said that :)
[01-04-2006 15:50:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> doesnt
[01-04-2006 15:50:48] [#ezpublish] <xbit> sorry
[01-04-2006 15:51:28] [#ezpublish] <xbit> look in the logs xiglet, any more information there?
[01-04-2006 15:51:37] [#ezpublish] <xbit> var/log/
[01-04-2006 15:51:42] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> var/log/* don't say anything
[01-04-2006 15:52:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> /var/log/apache2/error.log
[01-04-2006 15:52:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1>  /var/log/apache2/error.log
[01-04-2006 15:52:47] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i was thinking more about the ezpublish-rootdir/var/log
[01-04-2006 15:52:57] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> neighter
[01-04-2006 15:53:15] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> it's correct to type "php -C cronjobs/rssimport.php" right?
[01-04-2006 15:53:28] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I installed php4-cli
[01-04-2006 15:54:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> php -C ./cronjobs/rssimport.php
[01-04-2006 15:54:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> but this should be the same.
[01-04-2006 15:54:57] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> yes ... this command don't prompt anything, but php -C runcronjobs.php gives me the error message i pasted
[01-04-2006 15:55:34] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> hmm ..  and shell u should have a max execution time
[01-04-2006 15:55:39] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> could it be something about my [php/apache/ezp]-version? it works on my debian server...
[01-04-2006 15:55:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> its set to 00
[01-04-2006 15:56:16] [#ezpublish] <xbit> you're using php 4.4.x with the 3.7.2 install and 4.3.x with 3.6.4 ?
[01-04-2006 15:56:22] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I could move the entire site to my debian server
[01-04-2006 15:56:39] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx1> i mean its set to infinit
[01-04-2006 15:56:48] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> yes (not really sure about php version on the 3.6.4 server)
[01-04-2006 15:57:21] [#ezpublish] <xbit> must just be kubuntu that sucks :p
[01-04-2006 15:57:28] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> :)
[01-04-2006 15:57:40] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> it's a bit bleeding edge
[01-04-2006 15:58:07] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> yes, the php version was 4.3.10-16 on the debian server (ezp 3.6.4)

[01-04-2006 16:09:52] [#ezpublish] <xbit> but without anymore debug information i guess it's impossible to solve it...
