[05-07-2005 04:45:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> anything new on the horizon, news of the wierd ...
[05-07-2005 04:45:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker>  yeah, vendors like that suck
[05-07-2005 04:45:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe i shouldnt buy from the cheapest ones
[05-07-2005 04:45:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it makes just building a computer on a budget a risk
[05-07-2005 04:46:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> well it's not like i couldnt stomach the 70$
[05-07-2005 04:46:09] [#ezpublish] * kracker shakes head back and forth ...
[05-07-2005 04:46:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> it just pisses me off
[05-07-2005 04:46:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> and the state the cpu arrived in isn't quite right iether: http://iota.root-servers.ch/ezpublish-devel/var/plain/storage/images/brokenathlonpackage/274-1-eng-GB/brokenathlonpackage.jpg
[05-07-2005 04:46:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> so far, after 2 days, no response to my complaint
[05-07-2005 04:47:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i've had it happen to me, not forgething all the motherboards i've fried just usting them , sniff i miss my dual athlon box
[05-07-2005 04:47:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> soon you'll get dual core athlon64 for cheap ;)
[05-07-2005 04:47:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> well i once fried a board mounting it without the washers
[05-07-2005 04:47:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> back when i was 13 or something
[05-07-2005 04:48:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> chuckes, those were the days ...
[05-07-2005 04:49:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> we even got the board replaced for free muahaha
[05-07-2005 04:49:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> well yeah in a lot of situations you have some leway, or at least some room to do something ...
[05-07-2005 04:50:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> but not with bloody onlineshops
[05-07-2005 04:50:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> sux
[05-07-2005 04:51:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> true, it can be like that, sometimes make me think, they do it just to make you fear to buy from anything but a major vendor + warrenty
[05-07-2005 04:51:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i guess it's a draw for what's more crazy
[05-07-2005 05:14:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> you mean buying from dell? over my cold dead body
[05-07-2005 05:14:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> vendors sell crap packaged in boxes
[05-07-2005 05:15:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> why would anyone buy a machine where they can't control the components going into it?
[05-07-2005 05:15:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> generally that crap is loud and hot
[05-07-2005 05:15:40] [#ezpublish] * buz has become silent warrior

[05-07-2005 17:52:57] [#ezpublish] <Larson> wtf is going on with google
[05-07-2005 18:11:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm ... seems to be ok. atm
[05-07-2005 18:14:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm ... after republishing an article this isnt refreshed on the user-website. its seems that svc doesnt work properly.
[05-07-2005 18:15:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> which is enabled.
[05-07-2005 18:15:20] [#ezpublish] <xbit> svc?
[05-07-2005 18:15:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> smart view cache
[05-07-2005 18:16:48] [#ezpublish] <xbit> okay, never heard of that, is that something brand new?
[05-07-2005 18:17:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well .. not really. take a look on settings/viewcache.ini
[05-07-2005 18:18:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this is a more intelligent solution to clear content-cache.
[05-07-2005 18:18:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> than using cache-blocks
[05-07-2005 18:18:47] [#ezpublish] <xbit> mm, i see
[05-07-2005 18:20:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> is your content-cache properly cleared after republishing something?
[05-07-2005 18:20:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> at least the altered object.
[05-07-2005 18:21:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Larson: are there known problems with clearing content-cache properly?
[05-07-2005 18:22:06] [#ezpublish] <Larson> not that we know of
[05-07-2005 18:22:19] [#ezpublish] <Larson> doesn't mean there are none
[05-07-2005 18:23:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well but basically not to clear the content-cache would be well known if there would be.
[05-07-2005 18:24:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> the default behavior of svc should manage the republishing i guess.
