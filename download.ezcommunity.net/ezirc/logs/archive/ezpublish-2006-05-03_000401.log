[05-02-2006 03:12:15] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> Hi there
[05-02-2006 03:12:42] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I am developping a new site in 3 languages. I plan to use the 3.8 for this
[05-02-2006 03:12:51] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> how should I process ? One siteacess per language ?
[05-02-2006 03:16:21] [#ezpublish] <zrg> afaik there is no other way, unfortunately :P
[05-02-2006 03:20:59] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok thanks
[05-02-2006 03:24:57] [#ezpublish] <zrg> what i do though is make siteaccess settings directories and softlink all files from main siteaccess dir into them, only individual one each has is site.ini with minimal settings
[05-02-2006 03:26:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> this way you will have same overrides working in all languages and wont get bughs because differing settings
[05-02-2006 03:26:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> interesting
[05-02-2006 03:26:58] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> thanks for the tip

[05-02-2006 07:17:49] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> question to all .... regarding fetch (content, SEARCH). has anyone tried to pass an array of class_attribute_id's to it? documentation seems to say that it is not possible, but only way to know is to try, unfortunately now I cannot code a sample page and try. anyone tried?
[05-02-2006 08:12:02] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> ok, I was able to code it into another install .. it works :)

[05-02-2006 08:59:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i saw this today on slashdot and thought of my _original_ thoughts on eZ publish v3.0

[05-02-2006 09:27:49] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> is there a way to retrieve the hostname in a template?
[05-02-2006 09:31:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> kalooni there is a contribution which gives you the full servervars
[05-02-2006 09:32:18] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok but I think I will use ezini to retrieve SiteURL value in site.ini
[05-02-2006 09:40:01] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> another question
[05-02-2006 09:40:15] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I am developping a multilanguage site with 3 languages
[05-02-2006 09:42:04] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I want to add a toolbar which will allow to switch from one language to another (like it is done on ez.no for example). What could be the best way to do this ? (ie fetching all languages)
