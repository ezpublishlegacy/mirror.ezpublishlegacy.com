[03-13-2006 07:02:39] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi, folks. We are currently getting little tiny bits of bandwidth and high packet loss from our missing servers and, if you can believe it, that's actually good news. Stay with us and we'll keep you posted.
[03-13-2006 07:03:30] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] For a bit more detailed information as available, please see wallops messages, which can be turned on via '/mode YOURNICK +w' on most clients
[03-13-2006 07:20:49] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. All service has been restored to the network and, so far, everything appears stable. A sponsor power outage caused most of our problems.
[03-13-2006 07:21:51] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Again, I want to take the opportunity to note that freenode could use additional large institutional sponsors, to help us provide more redundant services---if your organization is interested, please email me (levin@pdpc.us) with your particulars and we'll talk.
[03-13-2006 07:22:29] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] In the meantime, your client may not currently be identified to services; please identify or restart your client if that's more convenient. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for using freenode!
