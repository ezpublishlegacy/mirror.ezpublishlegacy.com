[05-02-2005 02:41:40] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> anyone know much about smart cache control
[05-02-2005 02:42:10] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I need to be able to clear a grandparent folder when an article is published
[05-02-2005 02:42:31] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> however the article is not technically related to the grandparent
[05-02-2005 02:47:15] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> The problem seems to be SmartCache can only access parents and related objects, my grandparent folder is neither]
[05-02-2005 02:48:21] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I have embeded a folder into another folder in order to produce a list of "5 latest articles"
[05-02-2005 02:48:40] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> and embedding does not constitute related it seems?
[05-02-2005 02:49:19] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> ie. the embeded folder is related of course, but not the children of the embeded folder which is what I display and thus need to clear\
[05-02-2005 02:49:29] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> any ideas one
[05-02-2005 02:49:34] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> fh?
[05-02-2005 02:50:10] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> how does ez.no build their frontpage, is it all template fetches rather than embeded nodes?

[05-02-2005 03:31:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> morning
[05-02-2005 03:32:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> what's up on your side of the net
[05-02-2005 03:32:21] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> how can i count invisible items using fetch('content', 'list_count',
[05-02-2005 03:32:44] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> my side? someting wrong?
[05-02-2005 03:32:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmmm, interesting ...
[05-02-2005 03:33:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you might have to do some work on that one
[05-02-2005 03:33:26] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> template operator?
[05-02-2005 03:34:04] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> any other way? don't want to hack kernel
[05-02-2005 03:34:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the answere would be to patch or extend to provide that support ( blinded by thoughts of paul's fetch operator work latele ) the other way might be an operator (that can be said of anything tho)
[05-02-2005 03:35:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it might be possible to fetch your items and then sift through them but that's a bit performance intensive on the server side

[05-02-2005 03:42:32] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> fetch and filter doesnt sound good. i'll try template operator
[05-02-2005 03:42:34] [#ezpublish] <danmiru> thanx
[05-02-2005 03:44:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i was trying to say that i don't think that fetching based on an attribute like hidden (status: show vs hide) exists todate in the kernel but that you could add it (fairly simply i think), if you are more comfortable an operator can be used as a reference for the kernel patch if someone else wants to do it later ...
[05-02-2005 03:46:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> .
[05-02-2005 03:47:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> happy hacking

[05-02-2005 12:42:49] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> two ways

[05-02-2005 12:43:46] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> {set folder_node_id_array=blah scope=root}
[05-02-2005 12:44:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i already tried the scope=global with no success.

[05-02-2005 12:44:47] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> and get rid of let
[05-02-2005 12:45:00] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> and/or, that is
[05-02-2005 12:46:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> why get rid of let? shouldnt be the variables writen with set declared by let?
[05-02-2005 12:46:56] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> {set} will create it if it doesn't exist
[05-02-2005 12:47:17] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> true.
[05-02-2005 12:47:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so u generally dont use {let}?!?
[05-02-2005 12:48:27] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> was giving me too much trouble.. i just {set} everything now
[05-02-2005 12:49:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> good to know. nice advice tho
[05-02-2005 12:49:14] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> don't have to worry about properly closing the {let}s and i generally need the variable throughout the page
[05-02-2005 12:50:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> yes. .. so i would have to get confused with scopes to transfer vars outside of the default namespace.
[05-02-2005 12:51:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> better said: to make the accessable outside the namespace.
[05-02-2005 12:51:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> +m
[05-02-2005 12:52:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> dispite of this its a mysterious: B:{$folder_node_id_array|attribute(show)} is in the scope of {let}.
[05-02-2005 12:53:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> -a
[05-02-2005 12:55:37] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> yeah... but theres scope of section too...
[05-02-2005 12:56:07] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> and its a loop.. so things get weird in a loop
[05-02-2005 12:56:19] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> like $item:varname

[05-02-2005 14:16:49] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> anyone here?
[05-02-2005 14:19:55] [#ezpublish] <xbit> hi bob
[05-02-2005 14:30:53] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hey xbit, how's it going?
[05-02-2005 14:31:03] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> (had a question but solved it) :D
[05-02-2005 14:31:10] [#ezpublish] <xbit> good
[05-02-2005 14:31:14] [#ezpublish] <xbit> alright i guess :)
[05-02-2005 14:31:33] [#ezpublish] <xbit> just tried ezp on a pII-300 :o
[05-02-2005 14:31:35] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> goodstuff. got any good projects going on?
[05-02-2005 14:31:41] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hehehe how'd that work out
[05-02-2005 14:32:04] [#ezpublish] <xbit> well...it worked after setting max_execution_time to infintiy
[05-02-2005 14:32:13] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> heheheh
[05-02-2005 14:32:40] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> did it speed up after it cached stuff?
[05-02-2005 14:33:00] [#ezpublish] <xbit> yeah, i bit
[05-02-2005 14:33:07] [#ezpublish] <xbit> but i intended to develop on that box
[05-02-2005 14:33:12] [#ezpublish] <xbit> and that's so not going to happen :)
[05-02-2005 14:33:28] [#ezpublish] <xbit> thinking about finding something else than ezp, something a bit more lighter
[05-02-2005 14:33:34] [#ezpublish] <xbit> :)

[05-02-2005 14:42:02] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> yeah.. ezp is nice but bloated
[05-02-2005 14:42:17] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> tried mojavi or propel + creole?
[05-02-2005 14:43:05] [#ezpublish] <xbit> nope, never heard of
[05-02-2005 14:43:08] [#ezpublish] <xbit> will check out :)
[05-02-2005 14:44:50] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> they look nice but haven't had a chance to try em yet
[05-02-2005 14:44:56] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> they're moreso frameworks than CMS...
[05-02-2005 14:45:11] [#ezpublish] <xbit> okay
[05-02-2005 14:45:15] [#ezpublish] <xbit> any urls?
[05-02-2005 14:45:37] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> thats what i like about ezpub.. they have a good framework..to some degree... only too bloated i think, the time it takes to learn ezpub classes/objects people could learn to do the stuff in php/mysql themselves
[05-02-2005 14:45:40] [#ezpublish] <xbit> searching for "mojave" just gives me desert :o
[05-02-2005 14:45:59] [#ezpublish] <xbit> hehe, yeah, kind of :o
[05-02-2005 14:46:12] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> http://phpdb.org/ http://www.mojavi.org/
[05-02-2005 14:46:45] [#ezpublish] <xbit> okay :)

[05-02-2005 15:13:53] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> question.. any of you know how to paste something into stdin and have it end up in a file?
[05-02-2005 15:14:11] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> ie something like: output.txt <
[05-02-2005 15:14:15] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> (paste my stuff)
[05-02-2005 15:14:17] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> ^D
[05-02-2005 15:14:20] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> and its saved
[05-02-2005 15:15:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> cat out.txt >> file.txt
[05-02-2005 15:16:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> agentbob: is that for what you are looking for?
[05-02-2005 15:17:00] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> no.. want to paste to console... not copy file :P
[05-02-2005 15:17:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> copy?
[05-02-2005 15:17:45] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ah .. ok. now i get what u mean.
[05-02-2005 15:18:17] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> i'm sure its a unix cmd just don't know the name of it :|
[05-02-2005 15:18:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> simply use a editor on the shell and use you mouse to paste the content.
[05-02-2005 15:18:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-02-2005 15:18:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> you could pipe
[05-02-2005 15:18:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> 2&>1 or something like that.
[05-02-2005 15:18:46] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> yeah... was sending weird chars to the editor though and didn't paste all
[05-02-2005 15:18:58] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> got it working in old vi though :D so no worried
[05-02-2005 15:19:02] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> no worries, rather
[05-02-2005 15:19:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah .. i have the same problem with vi. so use emacs or nano.
[05-02-2005 15:19:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> better said with vim.
[05-02-2005 15:20:19] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> have any good ways of debugging javascript?
[05-02-2005 15:20:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> the indention is set in a weired way when i copy more than one line into the vi-window
[05-02-2005 15:20:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i always use the firefox js-console.
[05-02-2005 15:20:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-02-2005 15:22:35] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> thanks for the tip
[05-02-2005 15:23:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> np, if this helps.
[05-02-2005 15:23:44] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> yeah.. thanks.. told me waht the problem was.. ie just wouldn't stop bitching and not say what was wrong
[05-02-2005 15:30:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hehe .. unless u have installed the NET-development environment providing debugging JS.
[05-02-2005 15:31:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> *duck*
