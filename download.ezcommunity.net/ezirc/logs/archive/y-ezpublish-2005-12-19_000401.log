[12-17-2005 04:06:24] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. In a few moments we're going to test a patch on one main rotation server which will hopefully result in our being able to reopen irc.freenode.net .... we'll have to reup the server...affected users about 2400.
[12-17-2005 04:06:44] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] If all goes well, we may reup the rest of the servers at some point over the weekend, perhaps this morning. Thanks.

[12-17-2005 04:29:57] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. Our patch was not as successful as we might have hoped. We're going to be tweaking the config lines and trying again, but it doesn't look hopeful. Thanks for your patience.
[12-17-2005 04:38:12] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. Okay, it's time to reup that server once more. We're going to tweak the patch, but it looks like we're getting about 20% of the bots or less. IF this tweak doesn't work, we'll go back to chat.freenode.net . For more information on why irc.freenode.net isn't working, and how to connect to freenode (please spread the word), see http://freenode.net/news.shtml .... thank you.

[12-17-2005 04:52:07] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. It's looking as if we should now be recompiling the rest of the servers and reupping the main rotation servers one at a time. I've had no reports of problems since the upgrade. That's not to say that the bots won't mutate sometime soon, but for now we can run irc.freenode.net.

[12-17-2005 05:18:41] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. Okay, here goes. In just a few moments, a rather large main rotation server will be restarted. It will be followed by another, and another, and then by smaller servers. Please bear with us.
