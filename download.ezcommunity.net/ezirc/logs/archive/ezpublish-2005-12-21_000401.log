[12-20-2005 03:23:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think (not looking at error logs anymore tonight) ... that i made lots of progress today (in a funny voice half certain) yes.. yes.. lots of progress
[12-20-2005 03:24:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> almost all the fatals in eZ publish 2 php5 are gone (on admin side at least)
[12-20-2005 03:24:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> indeed, kracker, i believe in you.
[12-20-2005 03:24:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> building list of eZ publish 2 URI 's for testing documentation to be started (to be written)
[12-20-2005 03:25:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> a few minor commits, little bugs i've fixed a thousand times for clients now finaly make it into trunk
[12-20-2005 03:26:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> eZpublish version 2?
[12-20-2005 03:26:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yup
[12-20-2005 03:26:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> as i understand you maintain a ezp version 2 svn tree?!
[12-20-2005 03:27:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this is not hosted on the ez.no site, or?
[12-20-2005 03:28:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> working on a rather large proposal for the community to bring it back into full compatablity with the latest PHP4.4 and PHP5 stable releases (which right now it's not stable or very comptable, limping along with at best php 4.3.9 support ) old crufty code gets a face lift, and a lot of documentation to at least document the problems which are warnings only ...

[12-20-2005 03:29:51] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm .. the question is why supporting and maintaining ezp v.2, better to persuade the clients to switch over to version 3?!?!
[12-20-2005 03:30:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> SEAwolfx, your right it is not supported or sponsored by eZ systems, tho they helped me get the svn trees
[12-20-2005 03:30:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> quite nice of them really :)
[12-20-2005 03:31:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah.
[12-20-2005 03:32:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> SEAwolfx, many users, developers and applications written in v2 do not translate to v3 without rather large hours of rewriting (basicly from scratch) to migrate to v3, many shops can not afford to do this others simple do not wish to do so
[12-20-2005 03:32:27] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> maybe u could persuade them to configure there svn-host properly that someone behind a proxy can do a svn checkout.
[12-20-2005 03:32:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> I maintain things the way they used to be as much as possible for those who are still geting the most out of v2
[12-20-2005 03:33:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i myself am looking forward to having enough time in components / v4 to see eZ publish 2 (large set of functionality in one package) to come again
[12-20-2005 03:34:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's often simpler to start v2 clients in v3 from scratch, often there is just no real benifit to upgrading to v3 for v3 sake, and v3 has been a very unstable branch in the past in many regards (thankfully now much beter ..)
[12-20-2005 03:34:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> SEAwolfx, what do you mean?

[12-20-2005 03:35:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> can't you checkout from pubsvn?
[12-20-2005 03:35:47] [#ezpublish] <kracker> na, i'm totaly confused :D
[12-20-2005 03:36:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i know pubsvn.ez.no is behind a proxy of some kind ?
[12-20-2005 03:36:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you were not talking about svn.ezcommunity.net where you ?
[12-20-2005 03:36:27] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> no .. i mean on client side.
[12-20-2005 03:36:39] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> no, about pubsvn.ez.no ;)
[12-20-2005 03:36:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i would file a very detailed bug report (on ez.no and email paulb about the problems)
[12-20-2005 03:37:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> only way to get the right feedback is to document and notify and stay on the matter
[12-20-2005 03:37:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[12-20-2005 03:38:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this failure occures when a create a package for ez, which should be possible to checkout the svn-trunk.
[12-20-2005 03:38:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> s/a/you/
[12-20-2005 03:39:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> and your sandbox is behind a proxy of course.
[12-20-2005 03:39:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i deal with people all the time who insult eZ systems to my face about every freaking thing under the sun possible and i laugh at them and tell them that they have not invested the pacience and time needed to achive your gains (aka all to often in the eZ world people are too impacienciant to get what they want but that doesn't mean that it's not possible)   a brief folklore.org store on eZ publish community : what it takes to
[12-20-2005 03:39:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker>  get what you want ....
[12-20-2005 03:40:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> SEAwolfx, i think i have heard you speak of this before in irc (or someone for that matter)
[12-20-2005 03:41:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> though you mention it failes creating a package for ez i imagine you mean the creation of the base packages files? wouldn't that be on the client size not server?
[12-20-2005 03:41:26] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this is possible that i have talked about it in former times.
[12-20-2005 03:42:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> no, not these kind of packages. i mean packages for installing ez, written for package-systems like portage or rpm.
[12-20-2005 03:43:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i totaly belive you, but that doesn't mean i completely understsand either :\ svn is a tricky deal at best (trunk/general), the way people most often think to get the latest stable from svn doesn't really work very simply in the eZ world (that's for sure ... or rather I don't know how it's supposed to work and i think few learn it on their own and get it working arggg)
[12-20-2005 03:43:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ahh
[12-20-2005 03:43:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i gotcha
[12-20-2005 03:43:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> that's lame
[12-20-2005 03:43:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> they are behind a proxy themselves
[12-20-2005 03:44:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ok ;)
[12-20-2005 03:44:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hehehe
[12-20-2005 03:44:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it would be nice to have a more accessable svn mirror for sure
[12-20-2005 03:45:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah.
[12-20-2005 03:47:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so now i'm curious, you going to file a bug/suggestion/feature request in the reporting system
[12-20-2005 03:52:10] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> when i can spend time for it. ;) there much other work to do right now.

[12-20-2005 04:02:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> doesent mean Katana the php upgrade to version 4.4?
[12-20-2005 04:07:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the worst thing is that we have no idea who did that
[12-20-2005 04:10:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> the system update, i guess.
[12-20-2005 04:10:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> like emerge -uD world

[12-20-2005 04:48:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana`: is the imagemagick php-extension enabled?
[12-20-2005 04:56:43] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> is it possible to change the owner of an object ?
[12-20-2005 04:58:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> SEAwolfx: i know what convert is ;)
[12-20-2005 04:58:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it is installed, it is working
[12-20-2005 04:59:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i don't think the php-ext is installed
[12-20-2005 05:00:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i guess this is required when you want to use the convert()-function wihtin php?!
[12-20-2005 05:01:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> DiGiTa|_: this should be possible to change the owner.
[12-20-2005 05:01:50] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yeah ok, but how :)
[12-20-2005 05:01:57] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> DiGiTa|_: php-way or backend-way?
[12-20-2005 05:02:03] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> bleh
[12-20-2005 05:02:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope, the imagemagick imagehandler uses the command line version of imagemagick
[12-20-2005 05:02:11] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i need a backend way
[12-20-2005 05:04:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana`: then no convert()-function is used. furthermore popen, exec or similar functions are used for that task?
[12-20-2005 05:06:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> DiGiTa|_: why you want to change the owner of an object? use-case?
[12-20-2005 05:06:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ...
[12-20-2005 05:06:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ..
[12-20-2005 05:06:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> SEAwolfx: i know a bit how the conversion works
[12-20-2005 05:06:45] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> .
[12-20-2005 05:06:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> a convert function is used, it is defined
[12-20-2005 05:07:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana`: thats not the point.
[12-20-2005 05:07:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but for some reason it is not found even though it is there
[12-20-2005 05:07:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ok so what's the point ?
[12-20-2005 05:07:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but not properly included?
[12-20-2005 05:07:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> convert is just the name of the function in the PHP class, that's all
[12-20-2005 05:07:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> either the function is not defined or its not included or the extension which provides it isnt enabled.
[12-20-2005 05:08:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> /home/www/sites/optic-shop.com/www/html/lib/ezimage/classes/ezimagemanager.php
[12-20-2005 05:08:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> this is the file with the error
[12-20-2005 05:08:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's part of the core
[12-20-2005 05:08:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and the convert method IS defined in the same file
[12-20-2005 05:08:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's not an extension, it's the built in image conversion feature
[12-20-2005 05:09:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> now i need to know if the error may be caused by PHP 4.4 + eZP 3.6
[12-20-2005 05:18:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> it seems that this function was envoked statically?
[12-20-2005 05:18:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> @Katana
[12-20-2005 05:19:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> no the convert-function rather the createImageAlias-function
[12-20-2005 05:19:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> s/no/not/
[12-20-2005 05:20:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but there are more references to $this before the convert-function is called.

[12-20-2005 07:32:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> are cli scripts in 3.7.2 somehow totally broken?
[12-20-2005 07:38:25] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> buz: works for me
[12-20-2005 07:38:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> weird

[12-20-2005 07:38:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> Fatal error: eZ publish did not finish its request
[12-20-2005 07:38:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> The execution of eZ publish was abruptly ended, the debug output is present below.
[12-20-2005 07:39:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> and the copysubtree one also gives fatalerrors
[12-20-2005 07:43:35] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> does the php-cli include mysql stuff?
[12-20-2005 07:44:03] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> try php -i|grep mysql
[12-20-2005 07:44:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> doesnt look like it, actually
[12-20-2005 07:44:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> but the thing comes from the same package as the module, wtf
[12-20-2005 07:45:12] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i know.. i had that problem before too...
[12-20-2005 07:45:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> on debian...

[12-20-2005 07:45:47] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> didnt think phpcli needed mysql...

[12-20-2005 08:02:51] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> Hey .... anyone can tell me if OE is configurable to add tags ? and in general, where to effect those configuration? so far, I was unable e.g. to add elements for the "class" dropdowns ... or to be sure I am correctly styling <h1..6> or enabling <br> if possible ... ?
[12-20-2005 08:06:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> This would assume that different xml-namespaces are supported when saving content.
[12-20-2005 08:13:43] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> SEAwolfx: can you clarify ?
[12-20-2005 08:17:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> when you add some tags of which namespace they should be? You want to extend the ezxml-namespace or introduce a separate new neamspace?
[12-20-2005 08:28:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> diff -R owns
[12-20-2005 08:30:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> -r even ;)

[12-20-2005 08:30:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> if you want to create normal patch-files, use diff -Nur
[12-20-2005 08:32:06] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok, we are getting to somewhere ... I think I can extend the ezxml namespace
[12-20-2005 08:32:14] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> that was for SEAwolfx :)
[12-20-2005 08:33:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> wouldn it be cool to have support for own namespaces?
[12-20-2005 08:35:07] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so you have to rewrite the validation of the ezxml-structure using DOM IMHO, what sucks.
[12-20-2005 08:35:12] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I suppose it would. I am just delving into ezoe ... and I'd like to know where are the available tags defined and how to extend / modify that set
[12-20-2005 08:36:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> SEAwolfx it was not a question
[12-20-2005 08:36:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it was a statement :)
[12-20-2005 08:36:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana`: is this a problem?
[12-20-2005 08:37:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> uh ?

[12-20-2005 08:38:09] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana`: You mean your statement on diff?! And I added some more infos to what you said?

[12-20-2005 09:11:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> SEAwolfx: there is a new parser in oe4 i think
[12-20-2005 09:11:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> not so much point in trying to understand the currrent mess i'd say
[12-20-2005 09:13:20] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> buz: and this OE is supporting different namespaces? this would be great!
[12-20-2005 09:13:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> no idea
[12-20-2005 09:14:15] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well ... namespaces are not a propriety of the OE , as it is only a layer upon the xmltext objects ... nay ?
[12-20-2005 09:14:49] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I think I can say with confidence that ... no, as to install OE you don't need to patch the kernel ;)

[12-20-2005 09:41:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> (... I was wondering a rather base question: why is the media subtree under a different section than content? )
[12-20-2005 09:42:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh
[12-20-2005 09:42:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I mean .. there mus t be a reason ... but I fail to see it at the moment
[12-20-2005 09:42:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i've spun this thread before ..
[12-20-2005 09:43:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i came up with, separation of content being (accessable) but not visable
[12-20-2005 09:43:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> in the (default) content structure
[12-20-2005 09:43:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i never much cared for it though
[12-20-2005 09:44:14] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I was wondering if there was some other reason -- at the moment I have a subfolder into "media" which belongs to the default section
[12-20-2005 09:44:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i tend to think it got in my way, but then the real answere must then be i don't really know how to use eZ publish in this way properly :?
[12-20-2005 09:44:25] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes me too ...
[12-20-2005 09:44:26] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well
[12-20-2005 09:44:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> at the very least, it will disallow your site being easily leeched of its media content (note the "easily")
[12-20-2005 09:45:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> apart from that ... duh ?
[12-20-2005 09:45:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i ended up storing my content as sub items of a parrent node (as needed) which (depending on what YOUR doing) can hide them but keep them accessable simply
[12-20-2005 09:45:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't think it does (protect) per say but what do i know
[12-20-2005 09:45:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> leachers are going to leach, no mater what
[12-20-2005 09:46:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you can just inhibit / slow them down (watermarks, direct access to files, etc)
[12-20-2005 09:46:23] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ah, now that is another nice thing ..... but if I - say - hide a folder, all the contents in it are not available -- at least, I tried it just a few days ago ,and it asks me to login (which is good)
[12-20-2005 09:46:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> exactly
[12-20-2005 09:46:34] [#ezpublish] * Sulfur nods
[12-20-2005 09:47:20] [#ezpublish] * Sulfur is listening to ytCracker -- view source :))
[12-20-2005 09:47:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i remember when hide was touted and eventualy released, i was like well this is coool but .... what about hide from menu (content structure) but still allow permissions ...
[12-20-2005 09:47:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh
[12-20-2005 09:47:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> anyway -- embedding hidden content into another tpl still does not make it available, right ?
[12-20-2005 09:47:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah i actually am a bit of a leacher (especialy as a kidd but not as much these days)
[12-20-2005 09:48:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i belive in the power of `view source` and think it's _wrong_ to play the other side of that fight
[12-20-2005 09:48:35] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> "throw your stone, you  who never leeched a site"
