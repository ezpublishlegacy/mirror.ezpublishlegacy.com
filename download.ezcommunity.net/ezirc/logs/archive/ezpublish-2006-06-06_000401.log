[06-05-2006 01:35:36] [#ezpublish] <zr1> hiya!
[06-05-2006 01:42:04] [#ezpublish] <zr1> is there a way to tell ez to clear all the crap it creates in global scope? I have a import script and it memory chokes after couple hundred items are created, i have no idea what to do.
[06-05-2006 01:42:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> run the script multiple times
[06-05-2006 01:42:47] [#ezpublish] <zr1> about 6000 times?
[06-05-2006 01:43:25] [#ezpublish] <zr1> i have thought of it but its not very good solution :P
[06-05-2006 01:44:07] [#ezpublish] <zr1> memory loss is about exactly 100kb per item
[06-05-2006 01:46:39] [#ezpublish] <zr1> i wonder what $script->shutdown() does..
[06-05-2006 01:48:40] [#ezpublish] <zr1> nope, shutdown/startup after each item doesnt help

[06-05-2006 04:46:36] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> and I cannot change it to the original one, damn :)
[06-05-2006 04:46:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> but I come with a nice question, that maybe someone has already taclked
[06-05-2006 04:46:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> regarding search
[06-05-2006 04:48:55] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> let's suppose I have a fetch(content, search .hash( ....)) restricted to classA, classB, classC . all these classes contain a Date attribute.
[06-05-2006 04:49:26] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> I'd want to have the result be ordered by this Date attribute, but I cannot seem to be able to write a correct sort_by for it
[06-05-2006 04:50:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> the Date attribute 's contents != published.
[06-05-2006 04:50:05] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> has anyone had this problem?
[06-05-2006 04:52:23] [#ezpublish] <zr1> not familiar and cant look into it right now sorry :(
[06-05-2006 04:53:35] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> ungh

[06-05-2006 07:18:02] [#ezpublish] <katana`> what dark side ? :)
[06-05-2006 07:19:03] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> just a manner of saying ... he left job and got into a 2-3 months vacation, that in my overworked and envious view is a dark side! ;)
[06-05-2006 07:19:42] [#ezpublish] <katana`> haha I see :)
[06-05-2006 07:20:10] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur__> was he showing up here?
