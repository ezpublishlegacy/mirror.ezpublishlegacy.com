[05-31-2006 04:46:44] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Hi!
[05-31-2006 04:47:07] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Quick question: How can I output just the url of an image?
[05-31-2006 04:47:51] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I can't get this way to work: <img src="{$node.object.data_map.bilde2.content[large].full_path}" />
[05-31-2006 04:49:31] [#ezpublish] <zr1> look in image overrides, full, embed etc
[05-31-2006 04:54:19] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> that's not right
[05-31-2006 04:55:23] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> $node.data_map.bilde2.content.large.full_path

[05-31-2006 04:57:34] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Still doesn't work
[05-31-2006 04:59:04] [#ezpublish] <zr1> you sure that node you want is in $node ?

[05-31-2006 04:59:53] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I think so.
[05-31-2006 04:59:57] [#ezpublish] <EsP> {attribute_view_gui image_class=refbilde attribute=$node.object.data_map.bilde2.content.data_map.image}
[05-31-2006 05:00:00] [#ezpublish] <EsP> does work
[05-31-2006 05:00:28] [#ezpublish] <EsP> But it's not what I want
[05-31-2006 05:00:51] [#ezpublish] <zr1> arent you missing .object. in there?
[05-31-2006 05:02:37] [#ezpublish] <EsP> doesn't work either way
[05-31-2006 05:02:40] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> what about this: $img=$node.object.data_map.image.content.data_map.image.content.original.url
[05-31-2006 05:03:26] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> change original by the variation you want
[05-31-2006 05:04:22] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I think that last one works. :)
[05-31-2006 05:05:15] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Thank you very much!
[05-31-2006 05:05:29] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> you are welcome

[05-31-2006 05:06:15] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Are you going?
[05-31-2006 05:06:26] [#ezpublish] <zr1> yeah
[05-31-2006 05:06:34] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> unfortunatly I won't be there ... it was planned but ... $$$ missing
[05-31-2006 05:06:55] [#ezpublish] <zr1> dang :(
[05-31-2006 05:06:58] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I'll try too, but I have so much work due.
[05-31-2006 05:07:08] [#ezpublish] <zr1> it is way, way too expensive, thats for sure
[05-31-2006 05:08:25] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I don't think it's too bad. The price for the new newsletter module is too expensive though. Blew me away. :)
[05-31-2006 05:09:02] [#ezpublish] <zr1> what module is that?

[05-31-2006 05:25:05] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hehe.. i got that reaction when i saw the price aswelll....
[05-31-2006 05:25:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> it took a while before i saw that it included more....
[05-31-2006 05:25:37] [#ezpublish] <zr1> from the description lots of custom code, not your usual template/class stuff
[05-31-2006 05:25:40] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> than just the soultion
[05-31-2006 05:26:08] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hmm.. strike that.. not just the code
[05-31-2006 05:51:10] [#ezpublish] <zr1> i am using $price->setAttribute( 'selected_vat_type', $vatType->attribute( 'id' ) ) to set which vat price uses, however seems not to work, when i go editing later vat is still at first option

[05-31-2006 07:56:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I want that user that login be redirected to their account page /user/edit/{$user.id}
[05-31-2006 07:56:54] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> how should I do this?
[05-31-2006 07:57:59] [#ezpublish] <zr1> cant use frontpage setting directly..
[05-31-2006 07:58:46] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> for the moment each time a user login he is redirected to the page he was before login
[05-31-2006 07:59:06] [#ezpublish] <zr1> use the redirect template function, its in contributions
[05-31-2006 07:59:40] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I know this contributions
[05-31-2006 07:59:46] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> did not think about it ;)
[05-31-2006 07:59:55] [#ezpublish] <zr1> then you can add some logic in pagelayout to redirect if just logged in
[05-31-2006 08:04:11] [#ezpublish] <zr1> what is the status of pdf-export of utf-8 content?
[05-31-2006 08:04:13] [#ezpublish] <zr1> impossible?
[05-31-2006 08:09:06] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> finally I have hacked the kernel/user/login.php file
[05-31-2006 08:09:45] [#ezpublish] <EsP> You are a hacker then?
[05-31-2006 08:11:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> sometimes it is easier to modify the kernel than using extensions
[05-31-2006 08:11:40] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> as extensions doesn't allow you to extends existing modules

[05-31-2006 13:28:41] [#ezpublish] <Enur> I was thinking of developing a site with ezpublish, i was shocked when i saw that you demand a license for the wysiwyg editor. Without an online editor you got nothing, so you could just charge people for downloading.
[05-31-2006 13:29:02] [#ezpublish] <Allman> listen pal, you do not need the OE to use eZp
[05-31-2006 13:29:18] [#ezpublish] <Allman> I personally never use it, because it is faster to just type in the markup directly..
[05-31-2006 13:29:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> and theres free replacements for it
[05-31-2006 13:29:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> (i must know, i wrote one)
[05-31-2006 13:29:37] [#ezpublish] <Allman> exactly
[05-31-2006 13:29:40] [#ezpublish] <Enur> like ?
[05-31-2006 13:29:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> xeditor or sjsd
[05-31-2006 13:30:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> and if you can live with xeditor's tradeoffs, it's MUCH better than OE, really
[05-31-2006 13:31:06] [#ezpublish] <Enur> ok
[05-31-2006 13:31:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> if you cant, sjsd is said to be quite good
[05-31-2006 13:31:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> i havent tested it myself though
[05-31-2006 13:31:27] [#ezpublish] <Allman> Enur: "without an online editor you've got nothing" is like saying: without cruise control you do not have a car.
[05-31-2006 13:31:32] [#ezpublish] <Enur> what are xeditors tradeoff?
[05-31-2006 13:31:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> ROTFL
[05-31-2006 13:31:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> you cant use PDF export

[05-31-2006 13:34:55] [#ezpublish] <Enur> well, i was thinking of the people who are going to update the site, write articles. they got little knowledge with tags and stuff like that
[05-31-2006 13:37:32] [#ezpublish] <ls_> I have not tired it yet
[05-31-2006 13:43:19] [#ezpublish] <zr1> so let them write text.
[05-31-2006 13:47:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> better not have lusers format text at all in my experience
[05-31-2006 13:49:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> in general, it'd be best to give them two or three formatting options
[05-31-2006 13:49:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> other than that they start formatting stuff like they use word
