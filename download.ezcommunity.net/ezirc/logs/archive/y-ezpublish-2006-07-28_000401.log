[07-26-2006 09:22:12] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> In "http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_8/concepts_and_basics/designs/design_combinations", what is meant by "A siteaccess should always have at least a main design and a standard design."?  Are main design and standard design templates, or folders, or settings in an ini file or some high-level abstract site concept?
[07-26-2006 09:28:40] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> have look in design directory
[07-26-2006 09:47:13] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> so it refers to the folders in the design directory?  Main would be my corporate_site?
[07-26-2006 09:48:07] -!- awormus_ [n=aaron@p54B079A5.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #ezpublish
[07-26-2006 09:48:15] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> is the "base" folder considered an "additional design"?
[07-26-2006 09:48:30] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> yes
[07-26-2006 09:49:07] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> "standard" is the root of all, if template is called and it is not in any additional design, it must be in standard

[07-26-2006 09:49:29] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> and how do I specify the "order" that it tries the different designs?  I realize it will try main first, and standard last, say I wanted to create another folder, called base2, how would I get it to look in it, and in what priority would it be used compared to base?
[07-26-2006 09:50:00] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> currently you have two: base and corporate
[07-26-2006 09:50:14] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> corporate is looked in first, then base, then standard
[07-26-2006 09:50:22] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> actually I have 4, base, corporate, standard and admin
[07-26-2006 09:50:36] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> there is ini setting, AdditionalDesigns or something like that..
[07-26-2006 09:51:00] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> yes but for user site, you use 3
[07-26-2006 09:51:13] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahh, gotcha...
[07-26-2006 09:54:49] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> hmmm, having trouble finding AdditionalDesigns

[07-26-2006 09:57:22] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> i guess it is in siteaccess site.ini
[07-26-2006 09:59:01] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahh, there it is!
[07-26-2006 09:59:22] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> sorry, I looked in there but missed it (I was looking for standard, but of course they don't explicitly list it).
[07-26-2006 09:59:25] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> cool, thanks!
[07-26-2006 09:59:46] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> and it would just test them in the order I list them I guess?
