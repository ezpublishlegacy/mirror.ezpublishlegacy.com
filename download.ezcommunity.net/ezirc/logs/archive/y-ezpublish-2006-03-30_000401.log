[03-28-2006 00:53:25] [#ezpublish] <awormus> is there a simple way to share users between multiple sites?
[03-28-2006 00:54:03] [#ezpublish] <awormus> it's mentioned on a page about the summer conference 2004, but says it's not implemented at the time
[03-28-2006 00:57:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> interesting ...
[03-28-2006 01:03:28] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> awormus: sso per LDAP would be an option - but don't ask me about the details :)
[03-28-2006 01:04:52] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> awormus: it also depends on what you mean with "multiple sites" - if it's just several siteaccesses in one eZ publish installation, then you use one DB for all siteaccesses and users are autom. "shared"
[03-28-2006 01:05:16] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> hi evby
[03-28-2006 01:05:22] [#ezpublish] <awormus> ordnas: thanks, that was the answer I was looking for :)

[03-28-2006 01:08:54] [#ezpublish] <awormus> ordnas: I'm still going through the details of how siteaccesses are handled, essenitally I want to have several systems which are totally seperate except for the users
[03-28-2006 01:09:56] [#ezpublish] <awormus> so I could have full administrational power over example.com/us/ but then people who signup on that site will also be able to puchase items in the shop at example.com/de/

[03-28-2006 01:19:45] [#ezpublish] <awormus> and another question: when it says that ezpublish only scales up to 250k objects, does this include user objects? I am looking at a site that already has over 140k registered users, so if this limitation applies to users as well the that might be a problem

[03-28-2006 07:29:12] [#ezpublish] <zrg> understood on second reading i think.. why wont relations to single cardinality datatype do?
[03-28-2006 07:36:34] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i feel you may have problems realizing datatype like this, the author type probably uses xml to keep all author lines in one database field, if it has a image file like you want you cant do that, i fear it may not be easy to have arbitrary number of binaries connected to node
[03-28-2006 07:36:37] [#ezpublish] <phretor> zrg: I can't use relations :-\
[03-28-2006 07:36:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> all just guesswork of course
[03-28-2006 07:37:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> why not?
[03-28-2006 07:37:45] [#ezpublish] <phretor> things must be published in one transaction and user must be unaware about relations
[03-28-2006 07:39:52] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it may be easier to write code to create and publish binaries as related objects, withing existing ez framework, than to hack it to support type like you propose
[03-28-2006 07:45:34] [#ezpublish] <katana`> you can create relations _ using a custom datatype _ without multiple user interactions
[03-28-2006 07:45:55] [#ezpublish] <katana`> the ezobjectrelationlist we currently have has these buttons for specific reasons, in order to be generic, but relations can be stored in one go

[03-28-2006 07:59:20] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: without user interaction? AFAIK the user must browse for existing objects and the creation of new objects in the right place is far from user friendlyness

[03-28-2006 08:05:50] [#ezpublish] <katana`> phretor: you can for instance propose objects the user can link to in a combo box
[03-28-2006 08:06:27] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: such objects must be created "on line" like you do for "Author(s)"
[03-28-2006 08:06:54] [#ezpublish] <katana`> well, depends if you link to existing objects or want to create new objects...
[03-28-2006 08:07:08] [#ezpublish] <katana`> you can perfectly create / remove the relations in the fetchObjectHTTPInput method of the datatype
[03-28-2006 08:09:33] [#ezpublish] <phretor> as a side note, is it possible to know if the current object view is line or full?
[03-28-2006 08:13:42] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> phretor: module_params() should return the current view
[03-28-2006 08:21:43] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> does POST or GET variable can be accessed from a template ?
