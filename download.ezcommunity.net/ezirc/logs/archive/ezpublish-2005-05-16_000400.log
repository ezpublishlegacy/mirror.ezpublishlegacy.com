[05-15-2005 22:16:48] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hey bedlore
[05-15-2005 22:16:53] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> how's it going
[05-15-2005 22:26:42] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> question... can i get a user object like fetch('user','current_user') but by specified user_id rather than current user?
[05-15-2005 22:51:40] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> agentbob: sorry in and out at the moment.  Good question I have never found the need to find that out
[05-15-2005 22:52:00] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> what are you trying to achieve?
[05-15-2005 22:52:52] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> need to find out which groups a certian user is part of
[05-15-2005 22:53:19] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> ah, yes I've done that before
[05-15-2005 22:53:20] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> fetch('content','object',hash('object_id', user_id_here)); gives a different object than fetch('user','current_user');
[05-15-2005 22:53:40] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> i need to do it for other users though... not just the current user
[05-15-2005 22:53:54] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> I did a look up on the groups for the user
[05-15-2005 22:54:03] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> why other users?

[05-15-2005 23:17:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i know the type
[05-15-2005 23:17:08] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> so his problem not mine... but now my problem!
[05-15-2005 23:17:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you can do it, i'd just make it sick as f*ck a string (wrapped in like 5 - 10 iterations of obfuscation)
[05-15-2005 23:18:17] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then write an operator to do the dirty
[05-15-2005 23:18:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sending clients cookies is simple, it's just http headers
[05-15-2005 23:19:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> erum, well that might not be exactly what you but but you get the idea
[05-15-2005 23:19:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> never seen it done here in the ezc tho

[05-15-2005 23:20:59] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> yeah but have no idea where to start to make it stick with ez system...i think its ezUserLoginHandler::instance... ->loginUser(login,pass);...
[05-15-2005 23:22:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> basicly a good idea
[05-15-2005 23:23:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> with a hook in current user? to check (aka cookie login?)
[05-15-2005 23:23:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i was thinking of if you added a setting to your user class (for your user edit screen aka checkbox)
[05-15-2005 23:23:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you could give them an option (if you need to)
[05-15-2005 23:24:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> or just do it transparently ... eh
[05-15-2005 23:24:18] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> still tricky.. cause ezpub does a buncha stuff in the bg when user is loggign in

[05-15-2005 23:33:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> wellll, i'm off to cut myself just to see how much it bleeds

[05-15-2005 23:33:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
