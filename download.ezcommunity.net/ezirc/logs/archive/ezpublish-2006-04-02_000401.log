[04-01-2006 16:00:44] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hmmm. You know, I could do an April Fool's Day joke, but maybe instead we should make this a group effort. Let's all just go to irc.oftc.net channel #oftc, and tell them that freenode has shut down and has repointed its servers to OFTC, and ask if they're going to be adding more facilities to handle the load. 8)
[04-01-2006 16:04:30] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Okay guys, thanks for the fun, let's let those poor guys on OFTC off the hook. :)
[04-01-2006 16:08:01] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Okay guys, give the folks on OFTC a rest, it was a good joke, time to go home. :)

[04-01-2006 17:25:27] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. On behalf of my self and all 200 or so people who participated in that April Fool's prank on OFTC, please accept our apology. I know that when you're the person pranked, it doesn't seem all that funny. So, apologies and bygones!
[04-01-2006 17:25:44] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Erm, assuming anyone from OFTC is still here. 8)
