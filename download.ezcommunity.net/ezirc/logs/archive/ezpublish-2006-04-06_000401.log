[04-05-2006 09:14:02] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kalooni, katana`: I cannot understand why an object of type Feedback Form correctly collects and send information while an object of type MyType does not. I correctly defined overrides for both collectedinfo/form.tpl and collectedinfomail/form.tpl.
[04-05-2006 09:15:07] [#ezpublish] <phretor> after the submission to (content/action) the page remains the same and the override of collectedinfo/form.tpl is not displayed. Any idea?
[04-05-2006 09:15:35] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> phretor: sorry no idea
[04-05-2006 09:16:07] [#ezpublish] <katana`> submitted content does not validate ?
[04-05-2006 09:16:43] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: the validation template (which is included as for feedback form's override) does not report any error
[04-05-2006 09:17:19] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: but let me review and paste the template somewhere
[04-05-2006 09:18:53] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`:  http://rafb.net/paste/results/Tbh9Nl18.html
[04-05-2006 09:19:24] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: it is the only form in the template
[04-05-2006 09:19:29] [#ezpublish] <katana`> I see
[04-05-2006 09:19:36] [#ezpublish] <katana`> I suppose that all the values in the hidden fields are correct ?
[04-05-2006 09:20:13] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: let me dump an HTML from that template
[04-05-2006 09:21:33] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: http://rafb.net/paste/results/Qzojfg26.html
[04-05-2006 09:21:51] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: the second form
[04-05-2006 09:24:28] [#ezpublish] <katana`> indeed it sounds correct to me...
[04-05-2006 09:24:42] [#ezpublish] <katana`> what you could do is enable DebugRedirection, DebugOutput, and see what content/action says
[04-05-2006 09:24:59] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: good idea for the redirection
[04-05-2006 09:25:08] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: lemme try
[04-05-2006 09:27:20] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: as a side note, I often see eZerrors like "No such attribute 'has_content'" but actually the attribute exists :-)
[04-05-2006 09:28:01] [#ezpublish] <katana`> hum that's weird...
[04-05-2006 09:28:08] [#ezpublish] <katana`> are you sure it does ? :)
[04-05-2006 09:29:21] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: it sometimes happends, yes
[04-05-2006 09:30:09] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: I can actually find, say has_content, looking at {$node.data_map.my_date|attribute(show,1)} output but it underlines me as an error
[04-05-2006 09:31:06] [#ezpublish] <phretor> katana`: No such attribute for object(ezdate): has_content - Choose one of following: timestamp, is_valid, year, month, day (for example)
[04-05-2006 09:34:30] [#ezpublish] <katana`> that's funny...
[04-05-2006 09:35:28] [#ezpublish] <katana`> i'm thinking that has_content may have to be implemented by the datatype, and may not have been implemented by every of them. It's probably part of eZContentObjectAttribute, which defines has_content, but if the datatype doesn't define it itself, it can't be used... not sure at all though :)
