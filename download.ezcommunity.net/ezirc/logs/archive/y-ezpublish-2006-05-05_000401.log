[05-03-2006 02:37:41] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. One of our sponsors requested that their server be removed from main rotation for some work, and it appears that the server was taken offline a bit earlier than anticipated. Apologies for the inconvenience.
[05-03-2006 02:56:56] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> uhm.. if I wanna upgrade the database from 3.7.5 to 3.8.0 ... should I just use dbupdate-3.6.0-to-3.8.0.sql?
[05-03-2006 02:57:16] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> can't find dbupdate-3.7.5-to-3.8.0.sql

[05-03-2006 07:17:28] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hi all
[05-03-2006 07:18:02] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> a quick one for you: is there any possibility to retrieve all the entered (text) content in a specified language, in the CMS, as a complete file
[05-03-2006 07:18:26] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> this file is meant to be given to a company who would translate the content to other languages...
[05-03-2006 07:19:02] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> Is there any built-in feature like this, or does it have to be developed ?
