[04-07-2006 04:18:25] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi there
[04-07-2006 04:18:38] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> did someone here has already installed an extension on ezpublish 3.8?
[04-07-2006 04:18:46] [#ezpublish] <zrg> not me
[04-07-2006 04:20:01] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I tried to install the xajax and the regexpline ones and I got a fatal error when trying to access my site after I've cleared the caches :(
[04-07-2006 04:20:11] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> => Fatal error: [] operator not supported for strings in /raid/sites/publication/nex_ez3_380/lib/ezutils/classes/ezini.php on line 659
[04-07-2006 04:22:00] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no idea :(
[04-07-2006 04:22:22] [#ezpublish] <zrg> maybe ext uses some php feature that is deprecated in php.ini
[04-07-2006 04:22:44] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I have this problem only on the 3.8
[04-07-2006 04:22:59] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> 3.7.5 ok
[04-07-2006 04:23:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> local php settings in .htaccess?
[04-07-2006 04:24:03] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> no
[04-07-2006 04:24:13] [#ezpublish] <zrg> dunno then..

[04-07-2006 04:48:45] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> well roadtrip is the title
[04-07-2006 04:48:51] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> can be somthing else i think
[04-07-2006 04:49:16] [#ezpublish] <zrg> gotta run, show me the lightbox thing later :)

[04-07-2006 04:50:34] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it's a devel site, so it's only local
[04-07-2006 04:50:37] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> sorry
[04-07-2006 04:50:58] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> no pb

[04-07-2006 18:27:03] [#ezpublish] <phretor> hi there
[04-07-2006 18:28:41] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I need to move my first step toward devel - I need to add a custom template operator acting as "wash" but it has to provide "textile"-like features. What about a good starting point?
[04-07-2006 18:56:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm, neat
[04-07-2006 18:57:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think there are several contrib operators at http://ez.no/community/contribs
[04-07-2006 18:57:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> specificly: http://ez.no/community/contribs/template_plugins
[04-07-2006 18:58:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i would find one close to your needs and use it as a guide to writing your own from scratch
[04-07-2006 18:58:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> phretor, hoping this helps :)
[04-07-2006 18:59:03] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: yes it does :-)
[04-07-2006 18:59:39] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: anyway, no support for such a wash('textism') :-)
[04-07-2006 19:00:48] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I created 'extension/washtextism/lib/eztemplate/classes/eztemplatestringoperator.php' and activated the new extension but it does not apply over the original file :-\
[04-07-2006 19:00:53] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: any suggestion?
[04-07-2006 19:03:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm
[04-07-2006 19:04:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> what are texttile features
[04-07-2006 19:04:56] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: simple operator for translating _this_ into <em>this</em> and something like that
[04-07-2006 19:04:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you should be able to create a different operator, ie: with a different name than wash() say like washTextile() which would work like any other operator extention
[04-07-2006 19:05:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah what you are describing is fairly simple (i think)
[04-07-2006 19:05:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> try working with existing extention operators, learn how to install and use them first
[04-07-2006 19:06:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then modify a copy of a working one to meet your needs, the functionality of character search and replace is very basic
[04-07-2006 19:06:47] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you can do it ! :)
[04-07-2006 19:06:49] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: I don't need to define a new operator, I actually need to define a new type of washing, so wash('textile') would be enough. So I added a new case brace to the switch control into `function wash()` into that file
[04-07-2006 19:07:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> right but ... this would affect all existing use of the wash operator , which might introduce other negative features (but i'm not certain about this ...)
[04-07-2006 19:07:52] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: no because wash() implies wash('xhtml')
[04-07-2006 19:07:58] [#ezpublish] <phretor> and not wash('textism') ;-)
[04-07-2006 19:08:47] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: the original implementation of wash is not touched, at all - I simply plugged-in a new case ;-)
[04-07-2006 19:09:11] [#ezpublish] <phretor> leaving the definition of `wash` 100% backcompatible
[04-07-2006 19:11:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm ahh
[04-07-2006 19:11:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> that seems neat
[04-07-2006 19:11:23] [#ezpublish] <phretor> should 'extension/washtextism/lib/eztemplate/classes/eztemplatestringoperator.php' be loaded instead of 'lib/eztemplate/classes/eztemplatestringoperator.php' (original) if 'washtextism' is activated?
[04-07-2006 19:11:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> eeehyea, i'm a little grey on how that kind of override would work
[04-07-2006 19:12:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> in theory it prolly should be possible
[04-07-2006 19:12:16] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: actually, it does not work :-D
[04-07-2006 19:12:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but ... i'm too far away to know with any certainty
[04-07-2006 19:13:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but what i would do is first search, post to the forum, etc to find if you can override lib/ stuff etc to be certain / look for another extension which overrides something else in lib
[04-07-2006 19:14:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sry i just don't know right now
[04-07-2006 19:16:02] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: yes I'd browse the SVN a bit first
[04-07-2006 19:16:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[04-07-2006 19:16:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'm certain you'll get it man :)
[04-07-2006 19:17:15] [#ezpublish] <phretor> http://pubsvn.ez.no/community/trunk/extension/category/ it overrides stuff in /lib
[04-07-2006 19:18:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> kewl
[04-07-2006 19:20:12] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: my override is not considered at all :-/
[04-07-2006 19:21:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah i'd have to think that there was a (how you are implimenting it) error regarding the syntax of the requirred extention overhead files
[04-07-2006 19:21:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sry, i didn't know what to call those files (i suck)
[04-07-2006 19:22:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> autoloads?
[04-07-2006 19:23:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> like i say, i would install the category extention (for example), get it working then learn how it is doing so
[04-07-2006 19:23:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> *shrugs* not sure what more i can do .... dinertime ;)
[04-07-2006 19:27:37] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: what if I paste my version of eztemplate...php somewhere?
[04-07-2006 19:30:29] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: http://rafb.net/paste/results/AWLWnC72.html I didn't add too much, as you can see :-)
[04-07-2006 19:47:51] [#ezpublish] <phretor> kracker: gotta go, sleep time ;-)

[04-07-2006 22:06:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ensure you have added cases for your textism(etc) to all the areas used by others ( ie: i think i see a few you missed in another block of code / function) washTransformation ..
