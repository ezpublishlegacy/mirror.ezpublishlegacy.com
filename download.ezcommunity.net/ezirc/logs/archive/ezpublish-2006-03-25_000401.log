[03-24-2006 02:54:54] [#ezpublish] <awormus> I have some questions about the generation of static content with ezpublish
[03-24-2006 02:55:36] [#ezpublish] <awormus> I am working with a team who has a very large system already set up, they don't want to change the system but want to use a CMS to manage it
[03-24-2006 02:57:10] [#ezpublish] <awormus> would it be possible to use ezpublish to manage the content (articles etc) but then create templates so that ezpubish will generate the static html files (which sometimes will include PHP code) and will fit into the existing system
[03-24-2006 02:58:22] [#ezpublish] <awormus> so essentially add the user management and workflow from ezpublish and then push the generated pages statically into the existing system

[03-24-2006 18:01:34] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> I have just set up eZpublish using manual configuration but I can't get any content to be displayed to anonymous users without logging in. How would I (or where can I learn about) change that?
[03-24-2006 18:06:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sounds like permissions for your anonymous user (role) are set incorrectly, ie: not set to allow 'read' access to content objects
[03-24-2006 18:08:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_6/concepts_and_basics/access_control
[03-24-2006 18:09:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i've found what you describe on occasion when upgrading eZ publish or moving eZ publish between hosts ;
[03-24-2006 18:09:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> :\
[03-24-2006 18:09:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but not on installation
[03-24-2006 18:10:27] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> please consider that I'm an absolute newbie with eZpublish, I'm just trying to evaluate it to see if it fits my needs
[03-24-2006 18:10:48] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> so please bear with me if I've not read the documentation thorougly, just the basic setup steps
[03-24-2006 18:12:17] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> when I go to "Edit <content/read> policy for <Anonymous> role" it says: "Module: content; Function: read; Function limitations: Class: any; Section: any; Owner: any; Nodes: 0"
[03-24-2006 18:19:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nw
[03-24-2006 18:19:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> no worries
[03-24-2006 18:19:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if you wish to evalute eZ publish I would consider trying one of the online demos
[03-24-2006 18:20:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> http://ez.no/products/ez_publish/demo
[03-24-2006 18:21:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm
[03-24-2006 18:21:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> well your doing beter than most
[03-24-2006 18:21:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you listed the right information right quick
[03-24-2006 18:21:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> an it looks ok at a glance
[03-24-2006 18:23:43] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i took a look at the demo, http://demo.ezpublish.no:83/corporate_admin/role/policyedit/333
[03-24-2006 18:24:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> what version have you installed (eZ publish / Apache)
[03-24-2006 18:24:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> my thought was to compare the settings in the demo against your own
[03-24-2006 18:24:46] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> eZ 3.7.4; Apache 2.0.55
[03-24-2006 18:24:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> great
[03-24-2006 18:25:20] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> I've found that RequireUserLogin was set to True in [SiteAccessSettings] in settings/site.ini, but setting it to False and clearing the ini cache has not helped
[03-24-2006 18:25:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm, well i would clear all cache to be certain
[03-24-2006 18:25:53] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> I've done that too to no avail...
[03-24-2006 18:25:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> that setting could be the culpret
[03-24-2006 18:25:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm
[03-24-2006 18:27:50] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> oh, forgot to say: I'm using PHP 4.4.2
[03-24-2006 18:28:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[03-24-2006 18:28:30] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> oh, hold a sec, maybe I can now run the system check wizard (I couldn't do that with 3.6)
[03-24-2006 18:29:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[03-24-2006 18:37:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> well man i wish you best of luck i have to get back to rebuilding my resume and wrapping up the day, cheers ;) eZ publish rocks, has never been better and is only going to get much better
[03-24-2006 18:38:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ciao
[03-24-2006 18:38:18] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> ok, thanks :)
[03-24-2006 18:38:47] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> I'm still running the wizard, maybe something was broken in config
[03-24-2006 18:39:39] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> thanks for the help anyway
[03-24-2006 18:40:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> np, i try to help out when i can (i'm not great, prolly just beter than a dead silence)
[03-24-2006 18:49:35] [#ezpublish] <pgimeno> kracker: now things looks quite different! it seems that the manual installation instructions may lack some important aspect because running the wizard has worked charmfully! in any case thank you very much for your help
