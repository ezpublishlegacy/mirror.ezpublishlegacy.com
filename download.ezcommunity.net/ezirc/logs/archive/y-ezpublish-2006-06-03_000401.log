[06-01-2006 03:40:40] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> good morning?
[06-01-2006 03:42:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hello
[06-01-2006 03:42:44] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> hey
[06-01-2006 03:44:42] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> humm.. I was actually kinda surprised when I couldn't find any nand, nor or neq-operators in ez
[06-01-2006 04:26:49] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> Tidemann: and( .., ..)|not
[06-01-2006 04:26:57] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> or( ..,..)|not
[06-01-2006 04:27:36] [#ezpublish] <kris10an^> Finding the syntax for neq is left as an excersise to the reader ;-)
[06-01-2006 04:44:55] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> kris10an^: i know.. but I assumed that at least nand or nor existed as they are quite basic logical operators...
