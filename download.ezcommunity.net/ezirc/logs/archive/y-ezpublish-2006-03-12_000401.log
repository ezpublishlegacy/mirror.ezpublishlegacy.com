[03-10-2006 03:33:35] [#ezpublish] <Shai-Tan> indeed
[03-10-2006 03:33:36] [#ezpublish] <puncept> allo shaishai
[03-10-2006 03:34:04] [#ezpublish] <puncept> so my main question is...
[03-10-2006 03:34:09] [#ezpublish] <puncept> yah
[03-10-2006 03:34:12] [#ezpublish] <puncept> i got this pretty design
[03-10-2006 03:34:33] [#ezpublish] <puncept> how do i implement that into the ezpublish engine?
[03-10-2006 03:35:31] [#ezpublish] <puncept> i'm reading the docs
[03-10-2006 03:35:46] [#ezpublish] <puncept> still would be of great help if anyone can conceptually describe.
[03-10-2006 03:37:03] [#ezpublish] <Shai-Tan> puncept: perhaps something here? -> http://www.sitepoint.com/article/ez-publish-3-1-take-spin/4

[03-10-2006 07:03:37] [#ezpublish] <phretor> hi ther
[03-10-2006 07:04:02] [#ezpublish] <phretor> {$module_result.path|attribute} outputs nothing. Why?
[03-10-2006 07:16:41] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> because you lack the (show, x) part
[03-10-2006 07:17:05] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> phretor: {$module_result.path|attribute(show)} is also enough
[03-10-2006 07:17:12] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> for 1 level depth
[03-10-2006 07:17:18] [#ezpublish] <phretor> let me try
[03-10-2006 07:17:49] [#ezpublish] <phretor> by the way, where do I have to place my own implementation of 'path.tpl'?
[03-10-2006 07:18:12] [#ezpublish] <phretor> design/mydesign/templates/parts/path.tpl?
[03-10-2006 07:21:26] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> phretor do you have an design extension?
[03-10-2006 07:21:43] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: an design extension?
[03-10-2006 07:21:59] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> yes. it is possible to have the designs in an extension
[03-10-2006 07:22:07] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> quite usefull :)
[03-10-2006 07:23:26] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> but templates/parts/path.tpl should work
[03-10-2006 07:24:25] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: I have my desing on my own subdirectory (design/plain)
[03-10-2006 07:25:05] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: if there's any good tool to speed up the development of my own design...please tell me :-)
[03-10-2006 07:25:10] [#ezpublish] <phretor> It'd be great
[03-10-2006 07:27:45] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> phretor: its not an tool
[03-10-2006 07:27:58] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> only a way to make it much more seperated from the kernel
[03-10-2006 07:28:05] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: ok, an extension of the ezSystem
[03-10-2006 07:28:11] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> ah no
[03-10-2006 07:28:20] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: is there any demo out there?
[03-10-2006 07:28:27] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> instaead of having your design in ezpublish/design/
[03-10-2006 07:28:40] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> you can make an extension where your design is included
[03-10-2006 07:30:07] [#ezpublish] <phretor> tobmaster: still not understanding, sorry. I'm perhaps too newbie for these topics
