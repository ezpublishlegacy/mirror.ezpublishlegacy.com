[06-25-2006 16:50:45] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. As you are aware, we experienced an episode some hours ago in which a staff password was sniffed or cracked. It would be prudent for you to change your nickserv and chanserv passwords at this point. We're continuing to investigate what happened. Thanks for your patience.

[06-25-2006 21:26:02] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. As you are probably aware, freenode has had some difficulties in the last day or so. One of our staffers, Susan Stewart (HedgeMage), will be on hand in #freenode-moderated in just a couple of minutes, to make a quick statement and take some questions. Thanks.
