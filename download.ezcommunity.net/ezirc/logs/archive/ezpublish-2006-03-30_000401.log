[03-29-2006 05:17:57] [#ezpublish] <phretor> hi
[03-29-2006 05:20:42] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I noticed that the cache is not well cleared, even with --clear-all. As a side effect override priority are not always respected. For example, I have overridden /content/datatype/view/ezbinaryfile.tpl with /content_view_ezbinaryfile.tpl (into my desing) and I raised its priority to '1'. Instead of *my* override, the one from the base design is used. Why?
[03-29-2006 05:21:07] [#ezpublish] <_buz> if you want to clear everything, delete everything in var/*/cache
[03-29-2006 05:23:04] [#ezpublish] <phretor> _buz: is it safe?
[03-29-2006 05:23:13] [#ezpublish] <_buz> should be
[03-29-2006 05:23:18] [#ezpublish] <phretor> :-)
[03-29-2006 05:23:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> never had any ill effects for me anyway
[03-29-2006 05:24:14] [#ezpublish] <phretor> _buz: thanks
[03-29-2006 05:25:05] [#ezpublish] <phretor> _buz: and what about var/cache?
[03-29-2006 05:25:14] [#ezpublish] <_buz> you can clean that too
[03-29-2006 05:25:19] [#ezpublish] <_buz> not sure if its indeed used
[03-29-2006 05:25:32] [#ezpublish] <_buz> just dont delete the dir itself and it shouldnt affect anything
[03-29-2006 05:25:40] [#ezpublish] <phretor> _buz: it's seems to be used for ini files
[03-29-2006 05:25:43] [#ezpublish] <phretor> yes, of course
[03-29-2006 05:25:52] [#ezpublish] <_buz> inis are cached as well
[03-29-2006 05:25:57] [#ezpublish] <_buz> maybe those are there, yes
[03-29-2006 05:26:27] [#ezpublish] <phretor> so I can clean all dirs within var/plain/cache/ (for example)?
[03-29-2006 05:26:32] [#ezpublish] <ls> yes
[03-29-2006 05:26:38] [#ezpublish] <ls> and var/cache
[03-29-2006 05:26:47] [#ezpublish] <ls> dont delete storage dirs ;)
[03-29-2006 05:27:05] [#ezpublish] <ls> there are all uploaded files images, files, media, etc
[03-29-2006 05:27:17] [#ezpublish] <phretor> I was wandering why they didn't include this clearing procedures witin clearcache.sh
[03-29-2006 05:27:32] [#ezpublish] <ls> AFAIK there is bug reported about this
[03-29-2006 05:28:27] [#ezpublish] <phretor> ls: yes but it's quite old, I assumed they fixed clearcache.sh after that bug report
[03-29-2006 05:29:03] [#ezpublish] <ls> I will check what can be done in that case ...

[03-29-2006 14:42:46] [#ezpublish] <phretor> actually, it is not working for me
[03-29-2006 14:43:38] [#ezpublish] <phretor> in other words, autolink seems to be unimplemented in 3.7.3
[03-29-2006 14:43:44] [#ezpublish] <ls> http:// is mandatory
[03-29-2006 14:44:29] [#ezpublish] <phretor> ls: it's not, according to the doc
[03-29-2006 14:47:34] [#ezpublish] <ls> the is bug in doc or in autolink() tpl ;)
[03-29-2006 14:47:41] [#ezpublish] <ls> try with http:// will work then
[03-29-2006 14:48:53] [#ezpublish] <ls> imho in doc is mistake
