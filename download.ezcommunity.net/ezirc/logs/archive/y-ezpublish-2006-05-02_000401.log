[04-30-2006 02:33:08] [#ezpublish] <awormus> hi ordnas
[04-30-2006 02:33:36] [#ezpublish] <awormus> do you know if the may 1st deadline for conference registration is flexible?
[04-30-2006 02:34:52] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i certainly hope the _payment_ can be little later :P
[04-30-2006 02:43:25] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> hi awormus
[04-30-2006 02:44:05] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> awormus: I actually don't know, but I can't imagine that we won't accept your registration if it's just a few seconds late :)
[04-30-2006 02:45:22] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> awormus: did you already register via this form? http://ez.no/survey/view/8
[04-30-2006 02:45:49] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> the deadline is there because of the hotel booking AFAIK
[04-30-2006 02:46:05] [#ezpublish] <zrg> far as i know ez does the conference thing thru some other company specializing in it, so there may be deadlines they cant stretch
[04-30-2006 02:46:50] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> best, if you write to info@ez.no
