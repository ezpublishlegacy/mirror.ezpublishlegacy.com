[04-19-2006 00:12:28] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. Once again, we're still having problems with a kiddie attacking channels. You should definitely consider setting your channel to +R for now, if at all possible, until the problem is resolved. Apologies for the inconvenience.
[04-19-2006 00:24:40] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. We're currently having problems with trollbots on a number of channels, and as a result many channels are temporarily set to +R. If you can't talk on such a channel, please register with nickserv --- /msg nickserv help register .
[04-19-2006 00:24:48] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Apologies for the inconvenience, and thank you for using freenode!
[04-19-2006 00:48:04] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. You may want to consider reverting from channel mode +R at this point, though if our problem person comes back, we'd advise using it again promptly, and leaving it up for a while. Thanks to everyone involved for your patience!
