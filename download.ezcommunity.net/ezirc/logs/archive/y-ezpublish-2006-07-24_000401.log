[07-11-2006 18:49:27] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> is there some setting which determins which designs caches get updated if content is edited?
[07-11-2006 20:09:06] [#ezpublish] <SunRay_Home> zurgutt: if I understand you correctly... you created a new design, leaving your old design also intact. Did you update your ini settings to point to the new design?
[07-11-2006 20:09:26] [#ezpublish] <SunRay_Home> or does your admin/editor account still point to the old site design?
