[05-06-2006 18:41:05] [#ezpublish] <OpenMacNews> hi all. is ezComponents discussed here too?
[05-06-2006 18:43:01] [#ezpublish] <zrg> havent seen, as it is relatively new
[05-06-2006 18:43:21] [#ezpublish] <zrg> this would be the place though
[05-06-2006 19:05:36] [#ezpublish] <OpenMacNews> zrg: well, lets give it a try then :-)
[05-06-2006 19:05:38] [#ezpublish] <OpenMacNews> i just discovered/started using ezC, myself; in particular ezcConfigurationIniReader.
[05-06-2006 19:05:38] [#ezpublish] <OpenMacNews> question: can ini files define/use vars for, e.g. use in relative paths?
[05-06-2006 19:05:39] [#ezpublish] <OpenMacNews> or, to do so, would i have to use ezcConfigurationArrayReader ?
[05-06-2006 19:11:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have no idea, never even looked at it, sorry :)
[05-06-2006 19:28:33] [#ezpublish] <OpenMacNews> fair nuf. thx.  gonna just use the ArrayReader, anyway, methinks ...
