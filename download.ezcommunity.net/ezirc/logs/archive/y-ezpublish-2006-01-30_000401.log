[01-29-2006 05:17:45] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> is it possible to restrict the class-container by defining certain classes residing within that container? the other way is possible by setting a policy defining the parent-class of a certain class of the create-function. I want to be able to set the types of classes which can be subitems of a specific class.
[01-29-2006 05:19:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> a composition.
[01-29-2006 05:22:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hi ordnas, so read the new forum entry on ezpublish.de?
[01-29-2006 05:44:36] [#ezpublish] <ordnas> SEAwolfx: which one?

[01-29-2006 05:50:14] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> hi, how can I get the "last modified" attribute of an eZ content object throught somephp code ?
[01-29-2006 05:53:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> y_sabal: you could go through the contentAttributes of the 'content_version' attribute of a contentObject
[01-29-2006 05:54:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> y_sabal: but i am not sure of there is the 'last modified' information.

[01-29-2006 07:04:58] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> SEAwolfx: are you a member of the ez crew ?
[01-29-2006 07:05:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kalooni: no
[01-29-2006 07:05:14] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok
[01-29-2006 07:05:31] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> how long are you working on ezpublish ?
[01-29-2006 07:05:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> since 2.2 i think
[01-29-2006 07:06:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> why you are asking?
[01-29-2006 07:06:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> so you might be an expert ;)
[01-29-2006 07:06:39] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> uhm, hard to say.
[01-29-2006 07:06:44] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> curiosity ;)
[01-29-2006 07:06:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ok ;)
[01-29-2006 07:07:14] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I am working on it since about 2 months, and I have still a lot to learn ;)
[01-29-2006 07:07:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, for me either.
[01-29-2006 07:08:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +too
[01-29-2006 07:09:03] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> have you ever worked on the shop part ? Did you ever develop an extension ?
[01-29-2006 07:09:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yes, i have developed extensions.
[01-29-2006 07:10:08] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> may be then you could give me some ideas on how to develop one.
[01-29-2006 07:10:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but never were into the shop deeply.
[01-29-2006 07:10:34] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I found the eurofxref example on the ez.no site. I think I understood it quite well, but it is very basics
[01-29-2006 07:10:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hm, i think there are tutorials available on ez.no
[01-29-2006 07:10:40] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I need to extend the shop
[01-29-2006 07:10:51] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ah, ok.
[01-29-2006 07:11:25] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> and I need to extend the ezorder and I don't find anything on how to do this. The eurofxref is to create a module ... but I want to extend the shop module, and I don't know how to do this
[01-29-2006 07:11:52] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> Here are some stuff I want to develop: tracking number for orders. And vouchers system.
[01-29-2006 07:12:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> you should do this by difining a new extension an intervent by custom actions
[01-29-2006 07:13:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> *defining
[01-29-2006 07:13:19] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I did the tracking stuff, badly, by modifying the kernel... I now want to do this the right way, i.e with extensions ... Do you know an extension that extend a module ?
[01-29-2006 07:13:45] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> *looking*
[01-29-2006 07:15:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> currently i havent checked out all extension, therefor i can not search.
[01-29-2006 07:15:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +s
[01-29-2006 07:15:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> just look into each extension and search for an 'actions'-dir
[01-29-2006 07:15:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok i will
[01-29-2006 07:16:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kalooni: i have to set in your module ./actions/content_actionhandler.php
[01-29-2006 07:16:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> look into ./kernel/content/action.php for code.
[01-29-2006 07:17:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> also you have to override content.ini by extension/settings/content.ini.append
[01-29-2006 07:17:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> [ActionSettings]
[01-29-2006 07:18:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ExtensionDirectories[]=yourextensionname
[01-29-2006 07:18:34] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> in the concerning templates you have to set a form-part
[01-29-2006 07:18:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> <form method="post" action="content/action">
[01-29-2006 07:19:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> <input name="ContentObjectID" type="hidden" value="{$node.object.id}" />
[01-29-2006 07:19:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> <input type="submit" name="yourNewAction" value="LaLa" />
[01-29-2006 07:19:57] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hope this helps.
[01-29-2006 07:20:34] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes it definitively do
[01-29-2006 07:20:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[01-29-2006 07:23:27] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> dont touch the kernel, think of updates. you would have to merge the code manually, which is quite sucking.
[01-29-2006 07:28:10] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> that's why I want to develop an extension
[01-29-2006 07:28:20] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> thanks for your precious help ...
[01-29-2006 07:29:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> Concerning the tracking I have to create a new DB table to. Is it doable in an extension ... Does it make problems in case of update ?
[01-29-2006 07:41:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> re
[01-29-2006 07:41:41] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> re
[01-29-2006 07:41:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> was under the shower ...
[01-29-2006 07:43:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kalooni: you can use the ezDB instance.
[01-29-2006 07:43:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> normal procedure.
[01-29-2006 07:45:05] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok you mean that my extension installation should have a script that will create the table using ezDB ? Is that correct ?
[01-29-2006 07:45:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ah, you want to dynamically create ne tables?
[01-29-2006 07:45:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +
[01-29-2006 07:45:41] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> w
[01-29-2006 07:46:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> why you want to do this? db-normalization should do the job imo?!
[01-29-2006 07:47:02] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> not really. But I want to store tracking information in the DB. So I plan to create a new table ezorder_track which will contain the tracking number and the order id
[01-29-2006 07:47:41] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> Or add a field track_nr to the ezorder table (which is not a good solution regarding updates)
[01-29-2006 07:48:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> .oO(stored procedures would do that job?)
[01-29-2006 07:49:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but this would be a database issue.
[01-29-2006 07:49:22] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> heavly depending on the database in use.
[01-29-2006 07:50:47] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> you mean pb concerning mysql or postgres?
[01-29-2006 07:52:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yes. i am not sure about mysql 4.* feature according stored procedure.
[01-29-2006 07:52:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I know nothing about stored procedure ... I can't see why I should use this ...
[01-29-2006 07:54:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm, you could trigger on update of the ez_order table starting the stored procedure to copy values from the new insert to your introduced table.
[01-29-2006 07:55:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> or you have to dispose this to the application layer by managing this with your extension.
[01-29-2006 07:55:25] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> sounds like chinese to me ;Ã 
[01-29-2006 07:55:26] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ;)
[01-29-2006 07:55:34] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> my idea is:
[01-29-2006 07:55:40] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> create a new table ezorder_tracking
[01-29-2006 07:55:43] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> with 2 fields
[01-29-2006 07:55:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> track_nr / order_id
[01-29-2006 07:56:08] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> in the admin interface, modifying the orderview
[01-29-2006 07:56:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> by adding a form which contain a field tracking
[01-29-2006 07:56:42] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> when this form is submitted the tracking number is registered in the ezorder_tracking table
[01-29-2006 07:58:04] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> so to be the more efficient as possible, I think I should create a kind of new "orderview" template
[01-29-2006 07:58:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm .. so you would depend on the order-objects which could be deleted by the application, which results in offending data integrety.
[01-29-2006 07:58:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> .. when its for instance deleted.
[01-29-2006 07:59:09] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I didn't think about this. But the tracking number is added only when the order status is set to delivered ...
[01-29-2006 07:59:18] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> So there is no reason the order objects to be deleted ?
[01-29-2006 08:00:41] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> when i would introduce a table for historical information, i store all concerning information into it. redundancies are wished here.
[01-29-2006 08:00:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx>  kalooni | >So there is no reason the order objects to be
[01-29-2006 08:01:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ... oops
[01-29-2006 08:01:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kalooni | >So there is no reason the order objects to be deleted ? <-- when s.o. in the admin interface deletes an order.
[01-29-2006 08:02:01] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> what do you mean by s.o. ?
[01-29-2006 08:02:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> someone
[01-29-2006 08:02:12] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ;) ok
[01-29-2006 08:02:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[01-29-2006 08:02:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> innoDB (Delete on cascade ?)
[01-29-2006 08:03:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this is trigger on cascade.
[01-29-2006 08:03:27] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +a
[01-29-2006 08:03:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this assumes that the forein-keys are explicitely defined in the db-schema.
[01-29-2006 08:04:01] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes
[01-29-2006 08:04:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> imho, this isnt the case of ez-db-schema.
[01-29-2006 08:05:34] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> it seems it is not the case
[01-29-2006 08:05:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> unforunatley.
[01-29-2006 08:05:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +t
[01-29-2006 08:07:00] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> So, in order to keep data integrity, I should do a trigger on the delete order action, that will also delete the tracking number ...
[01-29-2006 08:07:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, you will have to keep it on the application layer.
[01-29-2006 08:09:33] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I just created my ezorder_tracking table
[01-29-2006 08:09:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but this would not make sense due to the task of your new table, which is actually a log table.
[01-29-2006 08:10:02] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I added a relation between ezorder_tracking.order and ezorder.id
[01-29-2006 08:11:12] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> as it would not make sense to delete from the db an order that has been set to delivered status ;)
[01-29-2006 08:11:47] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> SEAwolfx ... where are you coming from ? I am from France
[01-29-2006 08:12:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> is it possible in the admin interface to delete an order?
[01-29-2006 08:12:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kalooni: i am located in germany.
[01-29-2006 08:12:26] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok
[01-29-2006 08:12:33] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> your english is great ;)
[01-29-2006 08:12:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this explains my bad english ;)
[01-29-2006 08:12:38] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> where you in dortmund ?
[01-29-2006 08:12:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ah, no. more in the south - bavaria.
[01-29-2006 08:13:15] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I meant where you at the ez partner meeting in Dortmund ?
[01-29-2006 08:13:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> in -> at ?
[01-29-2006 08:14:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> no, this only concerned the administration of an ez-site.
[01-29-2006 08:14:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> it would be more interessting when the ez_components are presented.
[01-29-2006 08:14:39] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> s/would/will/ in march.
[01-29-2006 08:14:43] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I didn't really focused on ez component yet ;)
[01-29-2006 08:14:56] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> So I assume you are a developer ? right ?
[01-29-2006 08:15:08] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> Are you working for an ez partner ?
[01-29-2006 08:15:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, it seems.
