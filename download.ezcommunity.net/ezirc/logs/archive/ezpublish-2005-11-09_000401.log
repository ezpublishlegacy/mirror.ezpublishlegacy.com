[11-08-2005 06:37:20] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> because.... I have no idea why it is like that. I'd just write <h5>Could not login</h5>

[11-08-2005 06:44:25] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> so that is used for text that is autotranslated? i.e. helptext and such (not text I've written my self in articles etc)
[11-08-2005 06:45:13] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> correct

[11-08-2005 06:56:57] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> but, if that is autotranslated, why did that text still show up in English when the site main lang is norwegian? Is there a setting somewhere that has to be set?
[11-08-2005 06:58:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> rappy, if you don't provide the translations, ez can't do anything

[11-08-2005 07:00:44] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> ah, thought that text that was written by eZ-programmers already was translated in a file somewhere :)
[11-08-2005 07:08:26] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> _Rappy_: it is by default translated into nor_NO
[11-08-2005 07:08:33] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> other translations are provided by our users
[11-08-2005 07:12:18] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> yes, that's why I though. So why didn't it translate when my site it setup as norwegian?
[11-08-2005 07:16:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> are you talking about standard or custom text ?

[11-08-2005 09:48:40] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> very zen indeed
[11-08-2005 09:48:43] [#ezpublish] <zrg> three sqares, wasnt this ez logo
[11-08-2005 09:48:53] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> path_prefix can target a folder , example if your site is in "root">"sitefolder", you set path_prefix="sitefolder"
[11-08-2005 09:48:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> symbolizes broken page :P
[11-08-2005 09:48:55] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> lol
[11-08-2005 09:51:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope Sulfur
[11-08-2005 09:51:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it doesn't
[11-08-2005 09:52:32] [#ezpublish] * Sulfur feels like the Chosen One
[11-08-2005 09:52:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[11-08-2005 09:52:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> your teh neo
[11-08-2005 09:52:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> err the one
[11-08-2005 09:53:26] [#ezpublish] <zrg> hmm, useful, make mental note
[11-08-2005 09:54:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-08-2005 09:59:04] [#ezpublish] <zrg> now if only settings were inheritable in siteaccess..
[11-08-2005 09:59:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> YES !
[11-08-2005 10:00:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have site in two languages, had to duplicate all siteaccess settings from first so i could just change the locale. stupid.
[11-08-2005 10:01:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep...
[11-08-2005 10:01:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> I always use an extension for my sites now though
[11-08-2005 10:02:14] [#ezpublish] <zrg> elaborate?
[11-08-2005 10:09:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> like extension/mysite
[11-08-2005 10:09:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> with design, settings, etc etc
[11-08-2005 10:09:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that way I have a settings folder shared by every language
[11-08-2005 10:10:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and almost everything about my site is at the same place
[11-08-2005 10:10:46] [#ezpublish] <zrg> sneaky, melikes :)
[11-08-2005 10:10:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> trick given by ez ;)
[11-08-2005 10:10:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ez.no is an extension
[11-08-2005 10:11:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that way when I have custom modules & functions & operators for my site, they're at the same place
[11-08-2005 10:11:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> in siteaccess/mysite/settings i only have site.ini
[11-08-2005 10:12:06] [#ezpublish] <zrg> has anyone written about using this trick?
[11-08-2005 10:12:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no idea :)
[11-08-2005 10:14:07] [#ezpublish] <zrg> be first :D
[11-08-2005 10:15:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i could :)
[11-08-2005 11:11:16] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hum ... what would be the best way to make my own datatype which differs by very little from an eZ datatype? e.g. an integer field which doesn't have an edit tpl to make a counter??
[11-08-2005 11:16:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> copy and edit ez class definition?
[11-08-2005 11:17:40] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I'd love to know where it is :P
[11-08-2005 11:18:02] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> mostly, I am rather put off by the different structure of extensions and kernel

[11-08-2005 14:03:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> "coffee"
[11-08-2005 14:04:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> is there any work at all underway on a ezpublish calendar?
[11-08-2005 14:08:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> not me :(
[11-08-2005 14:16:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> everybody keeps asking me about the eZ calendar (v3)
[11-08-2005 14:16:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the eZ user group created a good spec
[11-08-2005 14:17:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but i have yet to hear of anyone working to impliment it todate, only requests to start implimenting it
[11-08-2005 14:17:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> errum buz
[11-08-2005 14:18:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah thats what i know
[11-08-2005 14:18:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> calendar is one of the killer features
[11-08-2005 14:18:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah, people sure would like one
[11-08-2005 14:19:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> problem i see is that's a fairly time consuming extention to create :\ and everyone seems to give up when i mention time == money
[11-08-2005 14:19:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[11-08-2005 14:19:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> not to mention its far from trivial
[11-08-2005 14:19:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> it'd be a 50000USD+ project
[11-08-2005 14:19:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> buz, see finally someone who really gets it
[11-08-2005 14:20:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> ehehe
[11-08-2005 14:20:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> i tried it myself
[11-08-2005 14:20:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sry, but i get bludgened so frequently on a daily basis it's a reprieve to hear someone `just get it`
[11-08-2005 14:20:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> i was thinking maybie could abuse phpicalendar as template operator and just feed ical into it
[11-08-2005 14:21:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> but phpical isn't entirely sane code either
[11-08-2005 14:21:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it could be broken down into 2 or 4 phases to get it started slowly to try to create an avalance effect but, someone is going to have to sell this thing first
[11-08-2005 14:21:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> i have little time to develop anything right now
[11-08-2005 14:22:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah, i did a lot of work on eZ calendar (V2) major additions but ...
[11-08-2005 14:22:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> and stealing a calendar from somewhere else creates all sorts of permission problems
[11-08-2005 14:22:26] [#ezpublish] <zrg> wheres the spec?
[11-08-2005 14:22:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> somewhere in ez edu user group
[11-08-2005 14:22:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> spec looks pretty sane
[11-08-2005 14:22:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> only nobody ever started
[11-08-2005 14:23:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i learned calendars do not work with computers very well calendars not computer like they have all kinds of exceptions and rules in the calendar calculation to consider / be accurate (can really be trying at times)
[11-08-2005 14:23:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh wait they are exactly like computers :D
[11-08-2005 14:24:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> na i just mean that there are a number of rules and exceptions involved and it's not as simple as most people think it is on the outset
[11-08-2005 14:24:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> calendars are trying
[11-08-2005 14:24:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> but in case of the web, the display part isnt trivial either
[11-08-2005 14:25:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> http://ez.no/community/user_groups/ezug_edu/projects/calendar
[11-08-2005 14:25:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> exactly
[11-08-2005 14:25:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> if you want to see the most impressive calendar ever, go to zimbra.com
[11-08-2005 14:25:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> http://ez.no/community/user_groups/ezug_edu/projects/calendar/specifications/calendar_module_for_ez_publish
[11-08-2005 14:26:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> but that 150mb of code for you
[11-08-2005 14:26:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> http://ez.no/community/user_groups/ezug_edu/forum_of_ezug_edu/calendar
[11-08-2005 14:26:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> woah
[11-08-2005 14:27:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah but last post is from june
[11-08-2005 14:27:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah cause they say use the spec, comments
[11-08-2005 14:27:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> instead
[11-08-2005 14:28:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but even those are stale
[11-08-2005 14:28:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> cruffty
[11-08-2005 14:31:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if anyone has a client who can be sold on the calendar, i'd consider putting some serious efforts from the team on it, just a thought
[11-08-2005 14:32:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah but good luck finding a client that pays even 20% of the calendar
[11-08-2005 14:32:50] [#ezpublish] <kracker> every problem is an oportunity
[11-08-2005 14:32:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah if you good time

[11-08-2005 14:33:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if a (single) client can't bear the cost, it's an oportunity to bring several client together to achive their goals
[11-08-2005 14:33:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah but the time to delivery would be high
[11-08-2005 14:34:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't know, 3 months for phases 1 - 2 ( possibly phase 3, depending )
[11-08-2005 14:35:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe if we could get cheap development time
[11-08-2005 14:35:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> what does a man month in eastern europe cost these days, zrg
[11-08-2005 14:36:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> schema, classes, backend, layout/render, intl/text, frontend, (restart whole thing for each wave of phases / features) (last) client side scripting ... (pieces in an order ...)
[11-08-2005 14:39:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> permission structure is the most complex
[11-08-2005 14:39:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> who can read what and even more importantly who can force whom to appear to what events
[11-08-2005 14:39:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> take a look at egroupware for ideas ;)
[11-08-2005 14:41:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah i always saw those as just a few of the variables which can be a problem for clean rendering if not handeled simply (the v1 calendar did this in a horrible way)
[11-08-2005 14:42:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> errum i said clean but i ment /fast/blinding
[11-08-2005 14:46:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't know about `force` but you sure have the possiblity of a number of value added features to encourage particiation in avents <= force apearances
