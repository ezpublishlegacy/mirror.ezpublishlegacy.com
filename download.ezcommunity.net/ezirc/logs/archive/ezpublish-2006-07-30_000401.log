[07-29-2006 12:12:57] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> is there any reason why sub types wouldn't have priorities?  I've created a new class, and when I add it to a folder, for some reason there isn't any priorities listed for them...  is this something I need to turn on?
[07-29-2006 12:13:47] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> if I add an article as well, it doesn't have a priority either...
[07-29-2006 12:15:04] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahhh, I had them sorting by publish date, once I changed this to priority, the priority field was displayed...  thanks and sorry
[07-29-2006 13:08:38] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> I'm using the on-line editor, and I've created a table, and I want one cell to have all the contents (text) centered.  There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this.  I can change it to <th>, which centers it, but it also forces all the text bold.  Am I missing something, or what's the easiest way to do this?
[07-29-2006 14:00:30] [#ezpublish] <birger> mark the text and center it?
[07-29-2006 14:04:47] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> how do I center it after I mark it?
[07-29-2006 14:04:53] [#ezpublish] <birger> nm, one cannot do that i see now...
[07-29-2006 14:04:56] [#ezpublish] <birger> :/
[07-29-2006 14:05:06] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> :-)
[07-29-2006 14:05:20] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> it seems like it should be part of the on-line editor, but its not...
[07-29-2006 14:05:42] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> someone requested it as a new feature earlier this month, so other people seem to have noticed the deficiency too...
[07-29-2006 14:06:22] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> right now I'm looking into setting up a "centered class" that I could apply to the cell properties, but I haven't done anything like this before (does this sound like the right approach to you, and if yes any suggestions on how to proceed?)
[07-29-2006 14:06:53] [#ezpublish] <birger> yep, that's my first thought too
[07-29-2006 14:07:06] [#ezpublish] <birger> make a class, and use that for the table
[07-29-2006 14:07:29] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> do I make a class like that through the admin, or directly in a file somewhere?
[07-29-2006 14:07:38] [#ezpublish] <birger> i meant, css
[07-29-2006 14:07:49] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahh...
[07-29-2006 14:07:56] [#ezpublish] <birger> sorry :)
[07-29-2006 14:08:17] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> its weird, I have css classes in the stylesheets (I think), but when I try to apply them (in the ez publish admin) it doesn't offer them as an option...
[07-29-2006 14:08:20] [#ezpublish] <birger> hmm, a bit pain
[07-29-2006 14:08:46] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> "#centered{" is the start of a css class, right?
[07-29-2006 14:09:13] [#ezpublish] <birger> hmm, i just include my stylesheets directly in the pagelayout file so i don't know..
[07-29-2006 14:09:18] [#ezpublish] <birger> .centered is class
[07-29-2006 14:09:34] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahhh, ok, I have a bunch of .style classes then...
[07-29-2006 14:09:38] [#ezpublish] <birger> # for ids; unique elements. . for classes
[07-29-2006 14:10:40] [#ezpublish] <birger> table .myspecialtable { td { text-align: center; } }
[07-29-2006 14:10:43] [#ezpublish] <birger> or something like that
[07-29-2006 14:10:48] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> and when I try to apply a class in the table it says "No classes are available for the element: <td>"
[07-29-2006 14:11:05] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahhh, sorry, I'll try your table suggestion...
[07-29-2006 14:11:29] [#ezpublish] <birger> hmm, wait, you probably need a class for the td too, or all cells will have centered text
[07-29-2006 14:11:54] [#ezpublish] <birger> table.myspecialtable { td.centered { text-align: center; } }
[07-29-2006 14:12:21] [#ezpublish] <birger> goddamn, i'm f*cked up
[07-29-2006 14:12:30] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> :-)
[07-29-2006 14:12:37] [#ezpublish] <birger> still not right
[07-29-2006 14:13:42] [#ezpublish] <birger> table.myspecialtable td.centered { text-align: center; } perhaps :o
[07-29-2006 14:16:15] [privmsg] <lilo> Hi....just a reminder. As of 11am GMT on Sunday, freenode will allow Tor access only via the hidden service. Please take a look at http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml and switch as soon as possible. It's easier than it sounds. Sorry for any repetition of this message. Thanks!
[07-29-2006 14:16:30] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> I put in all three class statements above, cleared the cache, and went in to edit the object again, and its insisting there are no <td> or <table> classes...
[07-29-2006 14:19:18] [#ezpublish] <birger> ah, it's probably not css classes
[07-29-2006 14:20:54] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> :-(
[07-29-2006 14:20:58] [#ezpublish] <birger> i'm really new to the online editor too :/
[07-29-2006 14:21:56] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> they show examples of the class in the xml tags reference at https://ez.no/products/ez_publish/documentation/reference/xml_tags but they don't really specify what is meant by class...
[07-29-2006 14:22:46] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> hmm, it DOES seem like they mean css class...
[07-29-2006 14:22:48] [#ezpublish] <birger> ah, you refer to css-classes
[07-29-2006 14:23:00] [#ezpublish] <birger> yep, but you have to explicitly make it available
[07-29-2006 14:23:10] [#ezpublish] <birger> look at this: http://ez.no/doc/extensions/online_editor/4_x/usage/formatted_text/the_class_parameter
[07-29-2006 14:23:27] [#ezpublish] <birger> AvailableClasses[] in content.ini seems to be the clue :)
[07-29-2006 14:25:10] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahhh!
[07-29-2006 14:30:02] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> hmm, I added "[literal]
[07-29-2006 14:30:02] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> AvailableClasses[]=center
[07-29-2006 14:30:47] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> " to settings/siteaccess/corporate_site/content.ini.append.php and it still isn't offering it to me as an option (I cleared the cache)
[07-29-2006 14:31:58] [#ezpublish] <birger> literal?
[07-29-2006 14:32:25] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> that's what http://ez.no/doc/extensions/online_editor/4_x/usage/formatted_text/the_class_parameter seemed to recommend...
[07-29-2006 14:32:49] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahhh
[07-29-2006 14:32:53] [#ezpublish] <birger> look in the content.ini under settings/
[07-29-2006 14:32:59] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> you change that to whatever you want it to be...
[07-29-2006 14:33:02] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ok, thanks! :-)
[07-29-2006 14:33:15] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> I should make changes in the override though, right?
[07-29-2006 14:33:27] [#ezpublish] <birger> yep
[07-29-2006 14:33:39] [#ezpublish] <birger> but the files in settings/ can be good as references sometimes :)
[07-29-2006 14:34:56] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> I'm clearing the cache right now, I've got a good feeling this time! :-)
[07-29-2006 14:36:20] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> grrr, still nothing in the cell properties (no classes available)
[07-29-2006 14:42:14] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> its weird, content.ini doesn't seem to be getting updated...  it still shows the [literal] I added before, and the original [td]
[07-29-2006 14:47:27] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> well, I manually (with the online editor turned off) added class="center" to the TD element, and that works fine...
[07-29-2006 14:52:31] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> lol
[07-29-2006 14:52:38] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> I was putting the override in for my site
[07-29-2006 14:52:50] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> should have been putting it in for my site ADMIN! :-)
[07-29-2006 14:53:08] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> made the change, and it showed up right away... (I'm so silly :-)
[07-29-2006 14:56:58] [#ezpublish] <birger> hehe
[07-29-2006 14:57:05] [#ezpublish] <birger> just get used to it ;)
[07-29-2006 15:13:48] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> I have a bunch of template overrides that look like:
[07-29-2006 15:13:52] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> [full_folder]
[07-29-2006 15:13:52] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> Source=node/view/full.tpl
[07-29-2006 15:13:52] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> MatchFile=full/links.tpl
[07-29-2006 15:13:52] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> Subdir=templates
[07-29-2006 15:13:52] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> Match[class_identifier]=folder
[07-29-2006 15:13:53] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> Match[section]=11
[07-29-2006 15:14:04] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> with different matchfiles for different sections...
[07-29-2006 15:14:33] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> only the last one in the files works.  If I change their positions, then whichever one occurs last in the file becomes the new only one that will work
[07-29-2006 15:14:45] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> the others default back to [full_folder]
[07-29-2006 15:14:45] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> Source=node/view/full.tpl
[07-29-2006 15:14:45] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> MatchFile=full/links.tpl
[07-29-2006 15:14:45] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> Subdir=templates
[07-29-2006 15:14:45] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> Match[class_identifier]=folder
[07-29-2006 15:14:46] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> Match[section]=11
[07-29-2006 15:14:53] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> design/standard/templates/node/view/full.tpl
[07-29-2006 15:15:25] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> am I doing something wrong with the matching?  I tried switching the positions of Match[class_identifier] and Match[section] but to no avail...
[07-29-2006 15:16:56] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> ahh, the group names need to be different...  sorry for bugging ya'all
[07-29-2006 15:17:27] [#ezpublish] <birger> sometimes it helps just letting it all out i guess :)
[07-29-2006 15:17:32] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> lol
[07-29-2006 15:18:43] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> it'd be nice if there was some sort of error checking for things like that...
[07-29-2006 15:19:49] [#ezpublish] <birger> mm, would've been nice
[07-29-2006 15:20:29] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> it could be a debug option, spit out an error if the ini files are incorrect...
[07-29-2006 15:21:47] [#ezpublish] <birger> yep
[07-29-2006 15:22:44] [#ezpublish] <Dodger> when I run things its all going to be better, I tell 'ya ;-P
[07-29-2006 15:22:56] [#ezpublish] <birger> hehe :)
