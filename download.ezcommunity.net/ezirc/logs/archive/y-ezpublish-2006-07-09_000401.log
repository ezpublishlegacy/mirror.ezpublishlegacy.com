[07-08-2006 01:43:15] [#ezpublish] <philG> hi all
[07-08-2006 01:43:47] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have problem to find the best solution to install eZ on a windows server

[07-08-2006 01:54:34] [#ezpublish] <philG> can i use apache 2 for ezp ?
[07-08-2006 01:54:53] [#ezpublish] <philG> or it's better to install 1.3 ?
[07-08-2006 02:23:30] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have probllem with convert.exe, someone can give me his path to this application ?
[07-08-2006 02:39:44] [#ezpublish] <philG> nobody here ?
[07-08-2006 03:33:15] [#ezpublish] <_kore> Apache 2 is no problem, even complete different webserver are no problem (like lighttpd), Windows should not be a problem either (even I would never try it)

[07-08-2006 04:27:26] [#ezpublish] <birger> windows is okay for development, and you get an easy all-in-one package for windows :)
[07-08-2006 04:27:46] [#ezpublish] <birger> philG: regarding the path you must figure that out yourself, depends on where you installed imagemagick
[07-08-2006 04:28:24] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have solve my porblem .. with imagemagicki for example
[07-08-2006 04:28:38] [#ezpublish] <philG> i don't use convert.exe but convertim
[07-08-2006 04:29:32] [#ezpublish] <birger> good :)

[07-08-2006 05:52:25] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have redirection problem qith the windows installer, imopssible for me to add a folder in the ezpublish folder and call it
[07-08-2006 05:53:01] [#ezpublish] <birger> what happens?
[07-08-2006 05:53:38] [#ezpublish] <birger> you have created a folder in the ezpublish directory wich you try to access via http://localhost/yourfolder/ ?
[07-08-2006 05:55:51] [#ezpublish] <philG> Erreur kernel (21) not found
[07-08-2006 05:56:45] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have just add a search folder in the ezpublish fodler
[07-08-2006 05:57:24] [#ezpublish] <birger> oh, not on the filesystem, i see
[07-08-2006 05:57:42] [#ezpublish] <birger> what is a search folder?
[07-08-2006 05:57:42] [#ezpublish] <philG> i think it's a rewrite problem
[07-08-2006 05:57:57] [#ezpublish] <philG> teh serach folder contain the application perlfectt
[07-08-2006 05:58:34] [#ezpublish] <philG> all is good on my linux server ... butr the configuration with the windows instaleller is strange and it's not work now
[07-08-2006 05:58:52] [#ezpublish] <philG> i can't see my folder
[07-08-2006 05:59:54] [#ezpublish] <philG> in fact in my template, i call this page on a iframe : iframe src="http://192.168.1.194/search/search_form.html"
[07-08-2006 06:00:19] [#ezpublish] <birger> so search IS a filesystem folder?
[07-08-2006 06:00:35] [#ezpublish] <philG> yes
[07-08-2006 06:00:48] [#ezpublish] <birger> okay, just got a bit confused :)
[07-08-2006 06:01:07] [#ezpublish] <birger> but then it's probably something with .htaccess
[07-08-2006 06:01:44] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> yes, htaccess explicitly gives permission to directories
[07-08-2006 06:02:10] [#ezpublish] <birger> if it works on the linux server, try just copying that .htaccess over to the windows box
[07-08-2006 06:02:57] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have done this .. no good result
[07-08-2006 06:06:40] [#ezpublish] <zurgutt> remove it
[07-08-2006 06:15:37] [#ezpublish] <philG> i think it's a problem with ezpublish.conf in apache
[07-08-2006 06:16:04] [#ezpublish] <philG> i'll back in one hour

[07-08-2006 06:54:26] [#ezpublish] <philG> nothing
[07-08-2006 06:54:59] [#ezpublish] <philG> so, i don't don't understand why i can add a filefoder in my ezpublish folder and put in what i want
[07-08-2006 06:56:00] [#ezpublish] <philG> the windows installer install a eZpublish folder with apache, php mysql ...
[07-08-2006 06:56:16] [#ezpublish] <philG> and in an ezpublish folder wich is the site
[07-08-2006 06:57:09] [#ezpublish] <philG> if i call http://localhost, i have the ezpublish site directly and i can't add a classical folder in
[07-08-2006 06:58:04] [#ezpublish] <birger> it should ofcourse be possible
[07-08-2006 06:58:36] [#ezpublish] <birger> can you access /design/ directly?
[07-08-2006 06:58:52] [#ezpublish] <birger> http://localhost/design/ or do you get an ezpublish error message?

[07-08-2006 07:01:03] [#ezpublish] <birger> hmm
[07-08-2006 07:01:28] [#ezpublish] <philG> but localhost/design is a ezp's folder
[07-08-2006 07:01:41] [#ezpublish] <birger> it's just a regular folder
[07-08-2006 07:02:00] [#ezpublish] <birger> perhaps it helps if you paste your .htaccess?

[07-08-2006 07:02:17] [#ezpublish] <birger> or ezpublish.conf too perhaps
[07-08-2006 07:03:50] [#ezpublish] <birger> hmm, it should work just without a .htaccess too i believe

[07-08-2006 07:08:14] [#ezpublish] <birger> oh dude
[07-08-2006 07:08:25] [#ezpublish] <birger> lots of rewrite rules in the config file yeah
[07-08-2006 07:08:48] [#ezpublish] <birger> and you have search there yes...
[07-08-2006 07:09:17] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have add the line

[07-08-2006 07:09:52] [#ezpublish] <birger> i believe it should be capitalized R
[07-08-2006 07:11:05] [#ezpublish] <birger> hmm, have you pasted the file two times?
[07-08-2006 07:11:19] [#ezpublish] <birger> or do you have to exact same virtualhosts?

[07-08-2006 07:23:33] [#ezpublish] <birger> then i'm out of ideas :(
[07-08-2006 07:30:53] [#ezpublish] <philG> i have exactly the same problem if i want install phpmyadmin for example
[07-08-2006 07:31:17] [#ezpublish] <philG> where i can put .... where i can call it ?
[07-08-2006 07:34:13] [#ezpublish] <birger> what do you mean "where i can put .... " ?
[07-08-2006 07:38:00] [#ezpublish] <philG> i put in my eZpublish folder
[07-08-2006 07:38:53] [#ezpublish] <philG> other qst... with this installer, no tools for restart apache ... how restart apache simply ?
[07-08-2006 07:39:53] [#ezpublish] <birger> i'm not sure, i don't remember the windows installer exactly
[07-08-2006 07:40:08] [#ezpublish] <birger> either stop/start manually or restart service
[07-08-2006 07:40:13] [#ezpublish] <birger> (if installed as service)
[07-08-2006 07:43:27] [#ezpublish] <philG> ok i can see phpmyadin with the rewrite rule
[07-08-2006 07:43:41] [#ezpublish] <philG> i can also read my search folder
[07-08-2006 07:45:21] [#ezpublish] <philG> but if i call localhost/search/search_form.html i have an ezp error
[07-08-2006 07:46:09] [#ezpublish] <birger> weird, ezp shouldn't have anything to do with that...

[07-08-2006 11:58:44] [#ezpublish] <mcarroll> yeah, i'd ruled zend studio out, not being floss, but since Gubed doesn't work, i might give the free trial of that a go
