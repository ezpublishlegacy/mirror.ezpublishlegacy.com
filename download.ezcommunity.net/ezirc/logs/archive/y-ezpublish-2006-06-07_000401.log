[06-06-2006 07:37:28] [#ezpublish] <EsP> I have a list of subelements which are folders. When setting different sorting orders the sorting appears right in admin but it just will not sort right in the menu of the site. Using the double top. Anyone had this problem?
[06-06-2006 07:37:43] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> :q
[06-06-2006 07:39:30] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Sometimes I whisper to myself: "Why can't it just WORK?". Who needs crossword puzzles when we've got eZ? :)
[06-06-2006 07:42:09] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Please, please help me. Anyone got a clue at least? :)
[06-06-2006 07:45:42] [#ezpublish] <katana`> EsP: it's probably not implemented right in the template
[06-06-2006 07:45:44] [#ezpublish] <katana`> that's all

[06-06-2006 07:55:28] [#ezpublish] <EsP> What's strange is that the sorting seems to work with an other list of subelements.elsewhere in the same menu.
[06-06-2006 08:15:34] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> EsP: what's the sort_by set to in the fetch?
[06-06-2006 08:15:59] [#ezpublish] <EsP> sort_by, $root_node.sort_array
[06-06-2006 08:16:38] [#ezpublish] <EsP> It's the default double top template.
[06-06-2006 08:17:20] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> EsP: but when you edit sort-order in ez admin on node 2 (I assume this is what you call $root_node) it won't work?
[06-06-2006 08:17:41] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Checking..
[06-06-2006 08:21:21] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Correct. It doen't make any difference.
[06-06-2006 08:21:46] [#ezpublish] <EsP> This list of folders is in a level below though.
[06-06-2006 08:22:26] [#ezpublish] <EsP> It's the second line forming the subnav.
[06-06-2006 08:22:58] [#ezpublish] <EsP> The toplevel conforms to the sort order I set for node 2.
[06-06-2006 08:34:16] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Ok. I suspect it to be the root_node reference to be the problem somehow. I managed to change it by setting $root_node to the value of the parent node of the list of folders, and then it works. Now this node sets the sorting order for all other second level nodes.. This isn't a problem though.
[06-06-2006 08:34:21] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Yet..
[06-06-2006 08:35:02] [#ezpublish] <EsP> Thanks for your help!
[06-06-2006 08:35:46] [#ezpublish] <EsP> My beer debt is growing at an alarming rate. :)
