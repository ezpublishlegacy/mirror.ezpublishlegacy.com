[05-24-2006 05:07:05] [#ezpublish] <zr1> put all caching on and install eaccelerator
[05-24-2006 05:09:15] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> kalooni: do you have a LOT of content?
[05-24-2006 05:11:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> quite a lot
[05-24-2006 05:11:52] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> less than 10k object but growing quite fast (new users)
[05-24-2006 05:12:24] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> so for eZ this is not really too much
[05-24-2006 05:13:03] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> we already have APC as php cache manager
[05-24-2006 05:13:06] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> well.. if it's a lot of content then the content navigation tree gets really big
[05-24-2006 05:13:29] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> i've seen admin content page being over 3mb
[05-24-2006 05:13:52] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I've solved this by using the ajax extention
[05-24-2006 05:13:59] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes, browsing the user section is really taking long time
[05-24-2006 05:14:07] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes I have it on my dev serv
[05-24-2006 05:14:16] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I will migrate it into prod soon
[05-24-2006 05:15:20] [#ezpublish] <zr1> you mean ezodcsm js menu?
[05-24-2006 05:15:37] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes
[05-24-2006 05:16:25] [#ezpublish] <zr1> it has some bug btw, at runtime the module goes through all nodes in site, which on my site with 40000 nodes creates memory overflow
[05-24-2006 05:16:52] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> interesting
[05-24-2006 05:17:19] [#ezpublish] <zr1> if you start getting segfaults switch to the older "experimental" dynamicmenu that does not have that problem
[05-24-2006 05:20:02] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> what about PreviewCache ?

[05-24-2006 07:28:45] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> then looping and modifying data_float of the price attribute for each products
[05-24-2006 07:29:04] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> so no new version
[05-24-2006 07:29:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> a little bit like it is done for quantity in one of the workflow

[05-24-2006 07:33:38] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> this could be compared to the update priority feature

[05-24-2006 07:34:59] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i see.. do you clear the cache after doing this?
