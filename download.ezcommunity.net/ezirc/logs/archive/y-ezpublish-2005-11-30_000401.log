[11-29-2005 03:21:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> morning folks
[11-29-2005 03:41:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> wow, the usa has no eZ publish referenaces?
[11-29-2005 03:41:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/references/filter/(country)/United+States+of+America
[11-29-2005 03:42:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i wonder how often they clear these out :\
[11-29-2005 03:44:40] [#ezpublish] * Katana` is amazed at how famous his ISP is: http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_49/b3962071.htm
[11-29-2005 03:50:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, 24mbps (you guys get all the best bandwidth) <grin />
[11-29-2005 03:52:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you have to be living like ON the access point but well, yes :)
[11-29-2005 03:52:17] [#ezpublish] * kracker is `this` close to defecting ... 
[11-29-2005 03:52:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i even get free fixed IP addrss and reverse DNS
[11-29-2005 03:53:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yah and here they want to fck with you for every bit, byte, feature, service, and restrict how you can use the service
[11-29-2005 03:53:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> err i'm having doubts about my connection lately :)
[11-29-2005 03:53:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> freaking vampires the lot of them
[11-29-2005 03:53:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm severely limited on BT... but i'm having problems with irc as well so i hope that's not it :
[11-29-2005 03:53:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[11-29-2005 03:54:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but as far as I know no ports are blocked...
[11-29-2005 03:54:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and uncapped connection, my god, that's good
[11-29-2005 03:55:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> lucky
[11-29-2005 03:56:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah
[11-29-2005 03:56:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> definitely
[11-29-2005 03:57:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> most isps i have encountered here in the lower48 ( what we alaskan's call hell on earth ), is (among other restrictions to get more business (2x cost) customers), no hosting your own servers ...
[11-29-2005 03:57:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-29-2005 03:58:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ehh, it wouldn't be so bad, i'm not trying to run my own slashdot off my cable modem just do some simple beta / development publicly ... (it's a joke), oh well
[11-29-2005 03:58:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> just going to have to rack another server in the colo (everybody's going to make their cut)
[11-29-2005 04:02:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-29-2005 04:05:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ahh i get it, they were moved in the last revision (re: references)
[11-29-2005 04:05:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[11-29-2005 04:05:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the old ones are still around at ... https://shop.ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/references/company
[11-29-2005 04:06:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> confusing, why they seem to be the same objects but some just don't show
[11-29-2005 04:08:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> weird
[11-29-2005 04:09:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ehh, i'm sure it's normal the one that i could find in there is not using eZ publish any longer ...
[11-29-2005 04:09:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ouchie
[11-29-2005 04:10:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sad for them, but it doesn't take much to guess just why :D (and that's an FB diss not eZ)
[11-29-2005 04:11:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> kracker: you allways have the US navy: http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/references/case_studies/navy_dasn

[11-29-2005 04:12:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, the navy, lol
[11-29-2005 04:12:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> still just comenting on the references filter results being 0
[11-29-2005 04:13:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> errum i ment,    .gov
[11-29-2005 04:14:24] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hehe,... if you use .dov, i guess you won't get that many... ;-)
[11-29-2005 04:14:44] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> .dov ?
[11-29-2005 04:14:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> don't tell me you have a .dov
[11-29-2005 04:15:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> can i have a .dov bar (ice cream)
[11-29-2005 04:15:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[11-29-2005 04:16:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> no, what i was saying is that using the references filter tool on the references page
[11-29-2005 04:16:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> does not show any result if you select the country "United States of America"
[11-29-2005 04:16:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> even if you leave all other options as "All" (default)
[11-29-2005 04:17:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> which means unless you really bounce ez.no through google or know a bit about ez url hacking .... one might get the wrong idea about eZ publish use in the USA
[11-29-2005 04:18:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[11-29-2005 04:18:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> indeed

[11-29-2005 04:20:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> just seems like either a bug, a choice or .... `other`
[11-29-2005 04:20:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> not that any of those are really any good
[11-29-2005 04:21:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'd say "other" :)
[11-29-2005 04:21:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but no results is just ... disenfranchising
[11-29-2005 04:23:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> alright, alright, | but i'm going to be kinda disapointed if i submit some of my references only for them to hit /dev/null
[11-29-2005 04:27:19] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> they are defenetly not sendt to /dev/null....
[11-29-2005 04:27:33] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> (i think)
[11-29-2005 04:27:58] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i sent an email about this to the respoinsible

[11-29-2005 04:33:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> wife beater ??
