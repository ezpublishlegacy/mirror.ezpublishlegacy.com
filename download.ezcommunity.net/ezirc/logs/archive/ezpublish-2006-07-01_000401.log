[06-30-2006 22:03:14] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. Please be aware that we're still getting people using that DCC exploit to knock people offline. If there's a chance you're on an affected router, please connect to freenode via chat.freenode.net port 8001, rather than port 6667 (the default). Thanks!
