[05-29-2006 04:20:23] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I have two different vhosts pointing to the same documentroot
[05-29-2006 04:20:30] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok
[05-29-2006 04:20:37] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> let's say that I have one for the cms, and one for the site itself.
[05-29-2006 04:20:54] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> by cms you mean the admin interface, correct ?
[05-29-2006 04:21:37] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yep
[05-29-2006 04:21:42] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> wait a sec

[05-29-2006 04:23:29] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> my second is www.mysite.com
[05-29-2006 04:23:50] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I want to have a first match which will associate cms.mysite.com to a given siteaccess
[05-29-2006 04:24:13] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> then, the second match should be on the first URI element, because i can have www.mysite.com/<lang>

[05-29-2006 04:32:25] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> and what about configuring lang.mysite.com ?
[05-29-2006 04:32:32] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> which version of ezp?
[05-29-2006 04:33:02] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> AFAIK you have to set up a siteaccess per language
[05-29-2006 04:34:15] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> they don't want to have lang.mysite.com

[05-29-2006 07:37:28] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> thx
[05-29-2006 07:38:33] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but it seems it is not the right one ... SmartCacheClear already enabled here ... and no effects
[05-29-2006 07:47:26] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> :-/
[05-29-2006 07:49:27] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> in viewcache.ini, there is also another setting
[05-29-2006 07:49:27] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> The method to use when finding caches to clear,
[05-29-2006 07:49:27] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> # possible values are:
[05-29-2006 07:49:48] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> # clear_object_and_parent_nodes_caches
[05-29-2006 07:49:58] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> and other values, for :
[05-29-2006 07:50:06] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> #ClearCacheMethod=<method_string>
[05-29-2006 07:51:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok I will have a deeper look at this ;)
[05-29-2006 07:51:22] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> thx
[05-29-2006 08:08:12] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> it works now ... thanks for the tip
[05-29-2006 08:12:23] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> good to know that it works
[05-29-2006 08:33:33] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> hi, how could i organize my site for a multilingual content? in ezp 3.8
[05-29-2006 08:34:24] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> must i set nodes below the principal node, setting a branch to my site content for each language?
[05-29-2006 08:34:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think so no
[05-29-2006 08:34:49] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the translation system is built-in in ezp
[05-29-2006 08:35:04] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the translations are associated to the object itself, not to the node
[05-29-2006 08:35:05] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> create a site access per language
[05-29-2006 08:35:28] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> and play with the Locale and ContentLanguage in site.ini [RegionalSettings] I think
[05-29-2006 08:35:30] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> a siteacces language?
[05-29-2006 08:35:54] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> exist a tutorial about that?
[05-29-2006 08:36:40] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> and i see EP uses /(language)/en-ENG in the url to change language, could i do it in other way?
[05-29-2006 08:36:41] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> as I have understood one article should be available soon, but not yet unfortunatly
[05-29-2006 08:37:23] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i think BW is thought to be multilanguage easy and when i try to do a real example,  i cant
[05-29-2006 08:37:29] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> EP, sorry
[05-29-2006 08:39:05] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> http://ez.no/products/ez_publish/documentation/configuration/configuration/language_and_charset/how_to_setup_a_multilingual_site
[05-29-2006 08:39:15] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> is this obsolete or is for 3.8 ?
[05-29-2006 08:40:53] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> do you know how to replace the "_" in URLs by "-"
[05-29-2006 08:45:37] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> A typical, simple configuration (though not the only) for a multilingual site is to have each language have a distinct directory after the main address to access a certain language (ie, site.com/index.php/en, site.com/index.php/es, etc). To configure this setup, we start by editing settings/override/site.ini.append with (some of this may have been done for you during the installation, adjust as necessary):
[05-29-2006 08:45:48] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> B--Killer, is this obsolete?
[05-29-2006 08:48:05] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i see the forums and the irc are a litle dead, all the support is by pay? or i am wrong and isnt a good day?
[05-29-2006 08:49:00] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i would like to learn a little of EP and collaborate writing artciles
[05-29-2006 08:49:09] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> at that point this is not obsolete no
[05-29-2006 08:49:31] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> this idea is to have different siteaccesses, and associate to each of them a different configuration
[05-29-2006 08:49:55] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> telling that the siteaccess /en will have its content display in english.
[05-29-2006 08:50:18] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the difference with 3.8 is that there are some new variables to manage the languages, and they are not yet documented if i'm not wrong
[05-29-2006 08:50:36] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> B-KiLLer` but you say the translate is builtin in objects, and the text i posted talk about to create directories for each language
[05-29-2006 08:50:47] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the point is that I'll stay with 3.7.6 or the latest in the 3.7 branch, as I encountered some bugs which I can't afford on production :-/
[05-29-2006 08:51:30] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the /fr, /en, and so on are not real directories.  In your configuration, you can say that an element of the URI is the corresponding to a site access
[05-29-2006 08:51:47] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so, if you have www.mysite.com/en/about, it's as if you were entering www.mysite.com/about
[05-29-2006 08:51:59] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> but with the EN content of the object 'about'
[05-29-2006 08:52:06] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> oh, thx
[05-29-2006 08:52:48] [#ezpublish] <jeremiah> i understund, i will try then, thx B-KiLLer`
[05-29-2006 09:09:16] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> does anybody here knows a script that do screen shots of websites ?
