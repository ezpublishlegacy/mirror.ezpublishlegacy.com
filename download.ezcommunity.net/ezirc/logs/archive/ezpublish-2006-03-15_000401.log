[03-14-2006 03:08:44] [#ezpublish] <puncept> hi!
[03-14-2006 03:14:54] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi
[03-14-2006 03:15:04] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> does anybody has ever develop a blog using ez?
[03-14-2006 03:18:14] [#ezpublish] <puncept> the blog should be pretty easy
[03-14-2006 03:18:16] [#ezpublish] <puncept> just install it
[03-14-2006 03:18:26] [#ezpublish] <puncept> and it should be pretty straightforward.
[03-14-2006 03:18:57] [#ezpublish] <puncept> choose the blog option
[03-14-2006 03:19:18] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes it is. My question concerns "categories"
[03-14-2006 03:19:29] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> how would you manage this on ez?
[03-14-2006 03:19:59] [#ezpublish] <puncept> Isn't there a function that allows you to create paths and categories?
[03-14-2006 03:20:06] [#ezpublish] <puncept> play around in the admin panel
[03-14-2006 03:20:40] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> humm will check again
[03-14-2006 03:23:11] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> not so obvious indeed
[03-14-2006 03:25:57] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> sandro groganz did it
[03-14-2006 03:26:31] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but I think it is by playing with folders and multiple nodes
[03-14-2006 03:35:31] [#ezpublish] <puncept> probably.
[03-14-2006 03:35:42] [#ezpublish] <puncept> Have you gone through the technical manual yet?
[03-14-2006 03:42:53] [#ezpublish] <_kore> kalooni, I added a Selection to my weblogentry object, and have a onpublish trigger, which uses an ini-defined mapping selectionentry -> rubricnode and links the weblogentry in the rubric according to the multiple selection
[03-14-2006 03:43:32] [#ezpublish] <puncept> I'm going through the entire technical manual now.
[03-14-2006 03:44:12] [#ezpublish] <puncept> That means I won't get to watch a movie tonight :|
[03-14-2006 03:44:16] [#ezpublish] <_kore> As you can see at http://kore-nordmann.de ;)
[03-14-2006 03:44:40] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> _kore: thanks ... seems a good way to manage this. the problem is that I have to make it simple for a client ... which mean he will never edit any ini file
[03-14-2006 03:45:37] [#ezpublish] <puncept> there needs to be more tutorials out there for manipulating ezpublish
[03-14-2006 03:45:39] [#ezpublish] <_kore> You only need to do it once, or when an rubric is added. Perhaps you can even manage to do it automagically with some kind of string comparision
[03-14-2006 03:46:13] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> will think about it ;)
[03-14-2006 03:51:50] [#ezpublish] <puncept> hesus there are plenty of web jobs in ny
[03-14-2006 03:54:53] [#ezpublish] <_kore> I didn't mention, but the most elegant way would be to create a new datatype, which gives you a list of child nodes (of specific criterias, like the contentclass, and depth) with checkboxes, and create the links on the creation of the object
[03-14-2006 03:55:18] [#ezpublish] <_kore> But this would take a bit more time to implement ;)

[03-14-2006 04:25:38] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hi guys
[03-14-2006 04:44:03] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> is there a way to make that fetch(content, search, hash(.....)) results be sorted by RELEVANCE?
