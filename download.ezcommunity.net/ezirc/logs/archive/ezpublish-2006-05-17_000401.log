[05-16-2006 01:33:39] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> B-KiLLer`: I ran into the same bug you had...
[05-16-2006 01:33:46] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> :-/
[05-16-2006 01:34:24] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I've already contacted eZ reguarding this, so they're aware of it..
[05-16-2006 01:35:46] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> did you find a way to reproduce this every time ?
[05-16-2006 01:35:48] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> B-KiLLer`: from what I understand, they had to delete the draft manually in the database

[05-16-2006 02:08:42] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i will use ezp 3.8 in 2007 i mean :)
[05-16-2006 02:09:47] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> why?
[05-16-2006 02:11:34] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> B-KiLLer`: is it this you experienced? http://ez.no/bugs/view/8287
[05-16-2006 02:11:39] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> apparently too many bugs
[05-16-2006 02:13:42] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> for the moment I didn't experience any
[05-16-2006 02:13:53] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> except may be the fact I couldn't override the embed-inline view
[05-16-2006 02:25:36] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> it's a real pity when you go to your customer, showing your nice creation, and then ...
[05-16-2006 02:25:44] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the unexpected thing happens :)
[05-16-2006 02:28:05] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes right :)
[05-16-2006 02:28:34] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> that always happen to me ... but in general it's my fault ;)
[05-16-2006 02:29:27] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> kris10an: I have to try this report, because I didn't use the back button of the browser, I only hit the discard draft button
[05-16-2006 02:35:55] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> question: in a loop {section loop=$array} what is the best way to know the current position ?
[05-16-2006 02:36:32] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> with foreach you can set a $key
[05-16-2006 02:37:23] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> {foreach $item as $key=>$array}
[05-16-2006 02:37:58] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> thx Digital
[05-16-2006 02:39:00] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> but isn't it {foreach $array as $key => $object}
[05-16-2006 02:39:39] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes
[05-16-2006 02:39:41] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> sorry :)

[05-16-2006 06:39:42] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> m0ns00n: there is no standard operator for doing it
[05-16-2006 06:40:04] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> its not hard to make one...
[05-16-2006 06:40:18] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> setup->rad->template operator wizard
[05-16-2006 06:40:40] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> but it makes the site increasingly hard to operate if there comes a new webmaster
[05-16-2006 06:40:49] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> he'd have to have a weekly course in the site, then eZ
[05-16-2006 06:40:50] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> =)
[05-16-2006 06:40:50] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> but there is an issue with viewcaching..
[05-16-2006 06:41:03] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I fixed it with a javascript
[05-16-2006 06:42:01] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> if you make the operator properly, the webmaster should not care :-)
[05-16-2006 06:42:17] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> soultions are good :-)
[05-16-2006 06:42:32] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> The site is already humongous with overrides, classes, subclasses, template hacks
[05-16-2006 06:42:40] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> We're soon moving the whole thing to another CMS anyway..
[05-16-2006 06:42:56] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> eZ gave new meaning to "easy"
[05-16-2006 06:42:57] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> =)
[05-16-2006 06:43:10] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> and became ezhhhhhh..
[05-16-2006 06:43:56] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> sometimes a system that is too generic makes the task harder than the system is flexible
[05-16-2006 06:44:14] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> ex might be usable for everything under the sun, but it makes it hard to do one thing well

[05-16-2006 06:48:04] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yes ?
[05-16-2006 06:48:31] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> B-KiLLer`: uhm.. the bug we discussed..
[05-16-2006 06:48:46] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yep?
[05-16-2006 06:49:33] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> Jo Henrik tipped me that the bug can be avoided by disabling EditDirtyObjectAction?
[05-16-2006 06:50:13] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> the actual bug is already fixed and will be out in 3.8.1
[05-16-2006 06:50:38] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> http://ez.no/community/bugs/editing_of_objects_crashes
[05-16-2006 06:51:21] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> do you suggest changing that setting, or get back the 3.8.1 from svn ?
[05-16-2006 06:51:55] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> disable the setting and wait for 3.8.1
[05-16-2006 06:52:19] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> ok
[05-16-2006 06:54:14] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> in the options mentionned in the base site.ini, there is only showversions & usecurrent...
[05-16-2006 06:55:18] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> it's set to usecurrent..right?
[05-16-2006 06:57:42] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> nope, showversions
[05-16-2006 06:57:47] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> ah..
[05-16-2006 06:58:02] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> it's probably a different bug then

[05-16-2006 07:09:59] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> AFAIK this bug is related to the new language system. It's the one kris10an mentioned earlier: http://ez.no/bugs/view/8287
[05-16-2006 07:12:11] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> okay ...
[05-16-2006 07:12:25] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I think I'm the "customer" mentioned here, and they told me over the phone they had to manually delete the draft in the database
[05-16-2006 07:13:27] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> kris10an: could you confirm this, or is there another workaround?
[05-16-2006 07:14:16] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> (Why did I hurry to install this 3.8 ? ;) )
[05-16-2006 07:15:43] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> B-KiLLer`: hehe.. you're not the only one ;)

[05-16-2006 07:22:59] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> the new features were appealing... sorry God for this, I won't be tempted again :)
[05-16-2006 07:29:10] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I'm still waiting for a GOOD treemenu I can use outside pagelayout.. I guess I'm just too lazy
[05-16-2006 08:15:26] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> Tidemann: the soluition is not to delete the draft in the database...
[05-16-2006 08:15:51] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> kris10an: k.. maybe I misunderstood then...
[05-16-2006 08:15:55] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i clicked on another editbutton, which for some reason works..
