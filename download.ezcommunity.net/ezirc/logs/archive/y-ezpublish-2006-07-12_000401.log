[07-10-2006 17:52:21] [#ezpublish] <src-afk> kracker: figured out the file upload issue. Wasn't eZ related. It's a PHP or Apache thing on our server. Weird stuff. We modified a width parameter on an image in the doc and it uploaded fine... dunno why PHP or Apache would be parsing the individual parts of the file being uploaded anyway
[07-10-2006 17:52:54] [#ezpublish] <src-afk> anyway... later
