[01-18-2006 02:57:19] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> I've got a problem with access rights... I'm using a XML block in a class, but when placing an image inside it, it's not displayed in the site, i'm getting a permission denied error
[01-18-2006 02:58:21] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> which is (are?) the correct role(s) I need to assign to the anonymous user (I guess) to have the requested permissions ?

[01-18-2006 04:29:45] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> B-KiLLer`: the image you place in the xml-block resides in another folder(media?). if so the permission for this folder must be set according to the access for anonymous user.

[01-18-2006 06:27:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> xmlarea is not compatible with 3.7?!
[01-18-2006 06:30:02] [#ezpublish] <zrg> how not?
[01-18-2006 06:30:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> you run xmlarea inside of 3.7?
[01-18-2006 06:30:43] [#ezpublish] <zrg> 3.6
[01-18-2006 06:32:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hm, on the  contrib page they not that its compatible with 3.5. despite of this I tried to install it on a 3.7 installation which failed.
[01-18-2006 06:32:13] [#ezpublish] <zrg> failed how

[01-18-2006 06:32:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hm, some js-errors appeared.
[01-18-2006 06:32:53] [#ezpublish] <zrg> btw, to correctly work on 3.6 get the 3.6 patched version from svn
[01-18-2006 06:32:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> thus the edit-menu didnt appear.
[01-18-2006 06:33:41] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> the patched version against 3.6 is commited in svn per default?
[01-18-2006 06:33:52] [#ezpublish] <zrg> huh?
[01-18-2006 06:34:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> or is this a special branch?
[01-18-2006 06:34:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> no matters, i always use svn here.
[01-18-2006 06:34:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i hacked it to work better on 3.6 and its some special branch
[01-18-2006 06:35:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so you made a simple svn co of the xmlarea extension?
[01-18-2006 06:35:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> s/co/check out/
[01-18-2006 06:35:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[01-18-2006 06:36:45] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i asked someone to do it
[01-18-2006 06:37:08] [#ezpublish] <zrg> was not done in best way it appears from someones comment on xmlarea page
[01-18-2006 06:37:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm :/
[01-18-2006 06:39:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> anyway, thanks for the info.
[01-18-2006 06:42:20] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it works quite well in 3.6 tho
