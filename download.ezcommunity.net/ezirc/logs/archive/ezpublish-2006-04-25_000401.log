[04-24-2006 13:51:38] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. Just a reminder. Google's Summer of Code ( http://code.google.com/soc/ ) is coming up again, and the mentoring organizations have pretty much all been selected. Coder applications start on May 1.
[04-24-2006 13:52:49] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Soc has moved to SlashNet this year, but it seemed to be a good idea to have an unofficial, local channel here on freenode for mentoring groups and participants.... so we've set up ##googlesummer .... if you're involved, or hoping to be involved, with Soc 2006, please stop by. As always, be nice, be chilled, and have a great evening! :)
