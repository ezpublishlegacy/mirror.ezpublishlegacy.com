[02-01-2006 04:24:17] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I have just written to ez-sdk a mail regarding (IMO) needed improvements to admin interface when dealing with large amounts of objects. specifically, multiple move / update / hide objects and search in content structure while adding related objects. having facilities for that would be a huge timesaver. how do guys here handle that ?

[02-01-2006 22:45:18] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> Anyone have ImageMagick 6.2.6 installed? I want someone to confirm if this is an ezp bug

[02-01-2006 22:47:09] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> anyone?
[02-01-2006 22:50:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sry, i don't (i think i was hovering around 6.0.7)
[02-01-2006 22:52:02] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> shame, it appears that the image datatype no longer works with imagemagick, very strange though but its all I can think of that changed at the moment
[02-01-2006 22:52:29] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> you can still upload images related resize etc, but not use the image datatype
[02-01-2006 22:52:45] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> guess I'll just report it as a bug and see if it gets confirmed
