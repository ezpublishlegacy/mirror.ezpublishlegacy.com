[04-10-2006 03:28:11] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> Hi: can someone explain me what static cache is
[04-10-2006 03:29:39] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> can a page which do a fetch can be statically cached ?

[04-10-2006 03:57:14] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I am not sure to understand the difference between satic cache and view cache, can someone help me on this point?
[04-10-2006 03:57:35] [#ezpublish] <katana`> view cache is the result of the content/view module stored as static html
[04-10-2006 03:57:50] [#ezpublish] <katana`> it doesn't include pagelayout, only the output of templates that override node/view/*
[04-10-2006 03:58:05] [#ezpublish] <katana`> static cache is the captured HTML output of a FULL eZ publish page
[04-10-2006 03:58:11] [#ezpublish] <katana`> e.g. what you see in your browser
[04-10-2006 03:58:35] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hum ok
[04-10-2006 03:58:51] [#ezpublish] <katana`> if something is not clear.. ask ;)
[04-10-2006 03:59:14] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> So if I have a part of my page that is dynamic (like the number of products in the basket) I should not use the static cache
[04-10-2006 03:59:24] [#ezpublish] <katana`> indeed not
[04-10-2006 03:59:31] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> argh
[04-10-2006 03:59:34] [#ezpublish] <katana`> :)
[04-10-2006 03:59:41] [#ezpublish] <katana`> static cache is... well, static
[04-10-2006 04:01:00] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok thanks katana it is clear now ;)
[04-10-2006 04:04:01] [#ezpublish] <katana`> np :)
