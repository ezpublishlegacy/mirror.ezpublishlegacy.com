[01-15-2006 09:23:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well, python rules my head to time.
[01-15-2006 09:23:37] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hmm.. i think i should spend more time on what i was supposed to do, than making scripts which visualize the ezcomponents...
[01-15-2006 09:23:47] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i've heard python is teh shit yeah :)
[01-15-2006 09:24:10] [#ezpublish] <xbit> good idea, kris10an

[01-15-2006 09:29:53] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> generated from the sourcecode...
[01-15-2006 09:30:29] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> ok.. lets get back to the thing i'm supposed to do then..
[01-15-2006 09:30:39] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> nice, it resolves the aggregations from code.
[01-15-2006 09:31:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this could piece of code could be used also for a bidirectional PHP-UML-Tool.
[01-15-2006 09:33:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> these are eZ version 4 classes?
[01-15-2006 09:33:51] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> SEAwolfx: that sounds like a bit more work than the few hours i spent on that
[01-15-2006 09:33:57] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> this
[01-15-2006 09:33:59] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[01-15-2006 09:34:02] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i spent on this
[01-15-2006 09:34:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i guess, yeah.
[01-15-2006 09:34:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> yes.. its the eZcomponents
[01-15-2006 09:34:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this code producing the images is written by u?
[01-15-2006 09:34:31] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> which will be a part of eZp4
[01-15-2006 09:34:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hopefully ;)
[01-15-2006 09:34:50] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no.. its uses "dot"
[01-15-2006 09:35:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ah, i know pydot which is a front end for graphiz
[01-15-2006 09:35:38] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> http://graphviz.org/
[01-15-2006 09:35:46] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> exactly..
[01-15-2006 09:35:51] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, i know.
[01-15-2006 09:36:09] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i found it earlier today.. and it looked so cool, i had to test it...
[01-15-2006 09:36:38] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> so then the piece of code which visualizes the components emerged..
[01-15-2006 09:36:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, i combined it with pygame, for interactive flow charts and workflow-modeling.
[01-15-2006 09:37:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> interactive? wow,... that sounds cool..
[01-15-2006 09:38:17] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i spend some weeks on it ... visual workflow-definition modeling ;)
[01-15-2006 09:38:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but now this faded in the background, earning some money is also important.
[01-15-2006 09:39:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[01-15-2006 09:39:17] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> it would be cool to have vizualised workflows with drag-and-drop support in ez publish
[01-15-2006 09:39:34] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[01-15-2006 09:40:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i also currently code on a workflow-engine implemented in python.
[01-15-2006 09:40:17] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> my idea was to connect it with eZ.
[01-15-2006 09:42:10] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but the workflow-concept of eZ is rule based instead of event based what makes it nearly impossible to create a usable wf-modeling tool ;D
[01-15-2006 09:43:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> would be cool to see your engine.. but i don't know squat about python ;-)
[01-15-2006 09:43:32] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hehe.. ok.. time to do the useful stuff...
[01-15-2006 09:43:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ok, stand it.
[01-15-2006 09:44:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kris10an: btw, what tool uses dot with this image-rendering?
[01-15-2006 09:46:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i'm not sure what you are asking.. but i'm using the "dot" commandline utility..
[01-15-2006 09:48:17] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kris10an: this tool should have read all the php-classes to produce the dot-script?!
[01-15-2006 09:48:55] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> yes.. i parse the sourcecode and generate a .dot file which is visualized with "dot"
[01-15-2006 09:49:15] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> very describing name... "dot"
[01-15-2006 09:49:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> parsed it with what?
[01-15-2006 09:49:44] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> shellscript+php
[01-15-2006 09:52:39] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> must have a recursive function ;)
