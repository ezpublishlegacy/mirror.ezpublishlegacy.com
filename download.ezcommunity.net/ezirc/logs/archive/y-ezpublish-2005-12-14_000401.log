[12-12-2005 04:38:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> and I cannot even find a node or eZ variable to check if it contains layout/set/print

[12-12-2005 04:53:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've checked and I don't think it's possible...
[12-12-2005 04:54:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's possible for layout/set.tpl
[12-12-2005 04:54:13] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> layout
[12-12-2005 04:54:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> 
[12-12-2005 04:54:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> Matches the name of the layout (for example "print", "fullpage", etc.).
[12-12-2005 04:54:19] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I tried t oset the persistent_variable but I get a slew of errors
[12-12-2005 04:54:38] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes, but that merely specifies what's the name of the pagelayout you want
[12-12-2005 04:54:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i suppose it's not available in the other views ?
[12-12-2005 04:55:41] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I wouldn't bet my life on my answer , but I think not
[12-12-2005 04:56:06] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I see there is a possibility of specifying an override condition based on persistent_variabel
[12-12-2005 04:56:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> so I was trying to set it in print_pagelayout.tpl
[12-12-2005 04:56:23] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but I get errors :))

[12-12-2005 07:58:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes

[12-12-2005 08:00:16] [#ezpublish] <buz> no idea

[12-12-2005 08:00:31] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> zrg: simple. my full.tpl override is good for web view, but print version needs no links , and so on ....
[12-12-2005 08:00:42] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ah
[12-12-2005 08:01:46] [#ezpublish] <zrg> perhaps pass a parameter, then use different template from full.tpl if parameter is set
[12-12-2005 08:02:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that's not overriding ;)
[12-12-2005 08:02:30] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> that could be a solution  pro tempore ...

[12-12-2005 08:04:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well, it's not a hack, but a workaround ... I think it could work
[12-12-2005 08:04:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I'll try it.
[12-12-2005 08:05:17] [#ezpublish] <zrg> wasnt there a override based on url?

[12-12-2005 08:29:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> is it me or you've been complaining about that since the components were released as beta ? :)
[12-12-2005 08:29:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm sure it would have been much better if the components had been kept a secret until ezp 4.0 was released

[12-12-2005 09:00:17] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> nfrp: CMS summer gangbang you say? that is going to be nice, with the massive amount of girls showing up :-p
[12-12-2005 09:00:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol yes
[12-12-2005 09:00:35] [#ezpublish] * Katana` is not gonna invite his gf, actually
[12-12-2005 09:00:53] [#ezpublish] <zrg> BOTH of the girls are coming?
[12-12-2005 09:00:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[12-12-2005 09:01:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you won't be able to hit on them with 200 guys around ;)
[12-12-2005 09:01:51] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ultracool, zrg
[12-12-2005 09:01:53] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have some tricks..
[12-12-2005 09:02:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well...
[12-12-2005 09:02:02] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> Katana`: you are not brining your GF? it will be nice for her there.... :-)
[12-12-2005 09:02:12] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yeah, bring her :)
[12-12-2005 09:02:15] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> she will get a lot of attention :-)
[12-12-2005 09:02:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, if it's a CMS gangbang i don't know actually :)
[12-12-2005 09:02:34] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> which is good for the selfasteem and stuff...
[12-12-2005 09:03:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[12-12-2005 09:03:28] [#ezpublish] <nfrp> ok, then we'll just order two busses of norwegian ladies instead. no one should  bring his gf .
[12-12-2005 09:03:28] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> so she don't like CMSes?
[12-12-2005 09:03:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> don't worry about my selfesteem
[12-12-2005 09:03:57] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> i wasnt talking about your selfesteem, i was talking about hers ;-)
[12-12-2005 09:04:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[12-12-2005 09:04:09] [#ezpublish] <nfrp> lol
[12-12-2005 09:04:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> /clear please
[12-12-2005 09:04:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-12-2005 09:04:20] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> hehehe
[12-12-2005 09:04:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> anyway i would really like to take her to norway
[12-12-2005 09:04:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i really enjoyed the last camp, even if it was not summer enough imho :)
[12-12-2005 09:04:48] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> yes.. but maybe its better to do that when nfrp is not around...
[12-12-2005 09:04:56] [#ezpublish] <nfrp>  you can also take her in norway. but you need to take her to norway first true.
[12-12-2005 09:05:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ...
[12-12-2005 09:05:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i think we're gonna get along well, nfrp :)
[12-12-2005 09:05:40] [#ezpublish] <nfrp> ( some kh is spreading sort of a awful image of frenchies working at eZ... )
[12-12-2005 09:05:42] [#ezpublish] <nfrp> :P
[12-12-2005 09:05:51] [#ezpublish] <nfrp> yes seems like :)

[12-12-2005 09:08:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> Katana` can take her to norway then the others can take her
[12-12-2005 09:09:11] [#ezpublish] * _Katana` stares at buz
[12-12-2005 09:09:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm a little out of whack today, i admit
[12-12-2005 09:09:33] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> yep a tad
[12-12-2005 09:09:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> could be worse though
[12-12-2005 09:09:47] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> yeah always

[12-12-2005 09:12:03] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> did you guys read "preacher"?
[12-12-2005 09:12:07] [#ezpublish] <lucifer_himself> best devil ever: al pacino in devils advocate
[12-12-2005 09:12:18] [#ezpublish] * Katana` agrees with lucifer_himself
[12-12-2005 09:12:24] [#ezpublish] <lucifer_himself> doesnt sound like something /me would read

[12-12-2005 09:12:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> preacher ? no i don't think so fh[eZ]
[12-12-2005 09:12:42] [#ezpublish] <lucifer_himself> he very obviously enjoys playing me
[12-12-2005 09:12:59] [#ezpublish] <lucifer_himself> (it is a nice job, after all ;)
[12-12-2005 09:13:05] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> http://www.neonwheels.com/preacher/index.shtml
[12-12-2005 09:13:07] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> that series

[12-12-2005 09:13:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm too sensitive for that

[12-12-2005 09:14:19] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> but it's very cool
[12-12-2005 09:14:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> fh[eZ], eZ question: alternative locations + search engine = ? issues ? :)
[12-12-2005 09:14:47] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> http://www.univie.ac.at/Anglistik/easyrider/data/preacher.htm <- better intro
[12-12-2005 09:14:54] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> check out "arseface"
[12-12-2005 09:14:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> sounds funny
[12-12-2005 09:15:20] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> Katana`: you'll get double results I think
[12-12-2005 09:15:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> actually no i think it does not even search in the alternative locations
[12-12-2005 09:15:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the search engine indexes content objects right ?
[12-12-2005 09:16:32] [#ezpublish] <lucifer_himself> it should
[12-12-2005 09:16:35] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> yes, true
[12-12-2005 09:16:39] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> ah, forget it
[12-12-2005 09:16:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> so it doesn't know about locations
[12-12-2005 09:16:48] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> I was thinking of a special implementation we have here
[12-12-2005 09:16:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i have to trick it since the main location is not to be seen
[12-12-2005 09:16:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nor opened
[12-12-2005 09:16:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> never
[12-12-2005 09:16:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the site may explode
[12-12-2005 09:16:58] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> the normal search engine just cares about locations
[12-12-2005 09:17:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> a special implementation ?
[12-12-2005 09:17:04] -!- lucifer_himself is now known as buz
[12-12-2005 09:17:06] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> for the doc
[12-12-2005 09:17:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hohoho
[12-12-2005 09:17:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> back to being incognito
[12-12-2005 09:17:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah, the famous "call me daddy" in the devil's advocate... :)
[12-12-2005 09:17:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> exactly
[12-12-2005 09:18:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> him being a lawyer is particularly fitting
[12-12-2005 09:18:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep :)
[12-12-2005 09:20:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> laying awake last night, an idea for a new data type struck me
[12-12-2005 09:20:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> basically, i want to create an ACL datatype so the owner of an object can decide who gets to do what with it himself
[12-12-2005 09:21:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> but it wont work without some kernel hackery
[12-12-2005 09:21:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> probably not
[12-12-2005 09:21:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> it'd be a very powerful tool
[12-12-2005 09:23:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> especially for community sites
[12-12-2005 09:27:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep definitely
[12-12-2005 09:28:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> nod
[12-12-2005 09:29:14] [#ezpublish] * Katana` was thinking about that NNTP <=> Forum gateway again the other day
[12-12-2005 09:35:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> it'd be neat
[12-12-2005 09:35:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> but a lot of work
[12-12-2005 09:36:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> well it kinda depends if you're gonna simply gate the stuff between usenet and forum or stick an NNTP interface on the forum...
[12-12-2005 09:36:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> for starters, working rss streams on ez.no would be much easier ;)
[12-12-2005 09:39:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> lol
[12-12-2005 09:39:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> no really, that would be a lot more useful than content/new to me
[12-12-2005 09:39:36] [#ezpublish] * Sulfur still has a fatal error on rssimport.php called by ez's cronjob
[12-12-2005 09:51:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hummm... any idea why even though content.ini.append is properly configured, changing the content of an object doesn't seem to affect the user site ?
[12-12-2005 09:52:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> broken caching?
[12-12-2005 09:53:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, it's most likely
[12-12-2005 09:53:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but what exactly ? caching is pretty vast :)
[12-12-2005 09:54:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> unclosed cache block maybe...
[12-12-2005 09:56:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no :(
[12-12-2005 09:56:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> caching is gigantic
[12-12-2005 09:56:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> and since i wanna become gigantic, too, i'm off to the gym now ;)
[12-12-2005 09:57:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-12-2005 09:57:47] -!- nfrp [n=nfrp@popeye.ez.no] has quit ["Leaving"]
[12-12-2005 09:58:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> some violent sport probably, working off anger from days worth of ez :P
[12-12-2005 09:58:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> anyway my caching issue is still there
[12-12-2005 09:59:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and clearing the content cache for that page did the job...
[12-12-2005 09:59:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> Katana`: now THAT is what I'd like to know .. I have the same issue sometimes
[12-12-2005 10:01:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i wish kris10an would say a word here
[12-12-2005 10:01:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> a useful one, related to the caching issue ;)
[12-12-2005 10:02:14] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> are you sure you set up content.ini correct for the siteaccess?
[12-12-2005 10:02:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that's what i'm triple checking
[12-12-2005 10:03:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's not [VersionView] is it ?
[12-12-2005 10:04:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yes it is...
[12-12-2005 10:04:52] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> versionview yes...
[12-12-2005 10:05:00] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> [VersionView]
[12-12-2005 10:05:00] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> AvailableSiteDesignList[]
[12-12-2005 10:05:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> this needs to be set correctly...
[12-12-2005 10:05:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> shit so it is
[12-12-2005 10:05:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> [VersionView]
[12-12-2005 10:05:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> AvailableSiteDesignList[]

[12-12-2005 10:05:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> sounds good to me
[12-12-2005 10:05:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> in settings/override/content.ini.append
[12-12-2005 10:05:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and not overriden by anything as far as I can see
[12-12-2005 10:06:05] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> are you having some crazy contentstructure which needs to clear all kinds of stuff?
[12-12-2005 10:06:28] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hmm.. is the node you are editing being updated?
[12-12-2005 10:06:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, the page i'm having the issue with is VERY simple
[12-12-2005 10:06:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> http://opticshop-online.com/faq
[12-12-2005 10:06:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> not related to anything and stuff
[12-12-2005 10:06:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we're gonna have other content issues but not there ;)
[12-12-2005 10:07:56] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> the cache is not being cleared for the node you are editing?
[12-12-2005 10:08:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep
[12-12-2005 10:08:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've checked, the old cache content is still on disk
[12-12-2005 10:08:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it shows correctly in admin / node/view/full as soon as edited but not on user site
[12-12-2005 10:08:35] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> (you can check the actuall value of the ini-settings in admin-interface... but i never try to change it there)
[12-12-2005 10:08:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've just done that it's correct
[12-12-2005 10:09:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> for admin siteaccess right ? since it's the one i'm editing from
[12-12-2005 10:09:06] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> did you spell the name of the desing porperly...
[12-12-2005 10:09:13] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no.. for user siteaccess...
[12-12-2005 10:09:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hum wait design ?
[12-12-2005 10:09:22] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> that is the one you want to check the values for...
[12-12-2005 10:09:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> isn't it access ?
[12-12-2005 10:09:30] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no.. its design...
[12-12-2005 10:09:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ...
[12-12-2005 10:09:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> content is cached for a... design ?
[12-12-2005 10:10:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> DAMNIT
[12-12-2005 10:10:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-12-2005 10:10:37] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> im not sure about the technicallities there.. but you need to specify the design...
[12-12-2005 10:10:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that array has to hold every design used as SiteDesign in various site.ini's right ?
[12-12-2005 10:11:16] [#ezpublish] <zrg> swearing prophecizes the truth
[12-12-2005 10:11:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> indeed it does
[12-12-2005 10:11:27] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> you should list the sitedesign for the siteaccess..
[12-12-2005 10:11:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> damn you fifteens !!
[12-12-2005 10:11:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yay
[12-12-2005 10:11:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> siteaccesses, please, 3 languages ;)
[12-12-2005 10:12:29] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> rite...
[12-12-2005 10:12:41] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> but you only have one sitedesign for each siteaccess ;-)
[12-12-2005 10:12:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah
[12-12-2005 10:12:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> actually they're cascaded
[12-12-2005 10:13:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> opticshop-lang => opticshop => standard
[12-12-2005 10:13:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and i didn't have opticshop-de in there since there is no siteaccess by that name...
[12-12-2005 10:13:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the site was only in 1 language in the beggining, the client thought 3 languages were implicit ;)
[12-12-2005 10:14:04] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> offcourse... there is allways 2 implicit languages...
[12-12-2005 10:14:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-12-2005 10:14:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> early specifications are for the weak
[12-12-2005 10:14:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> pwnage, it works
[12-12-2005 10:14:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> kris10an you're my hero
[12-12-2005 10:14:51] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> this one is the best.... http://www.start.no/tegneserier/dilbert/dil-striper/dil20051025.gif
[12-12-2005 10:14:57] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> but its in norwegian....
[12-12-2005 10:15:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> but i can give you the rought translation..
[12-12-2005 10:15:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it was translated by someone once...
[12-12-2005 10:15:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> translate again please ;)
[12-12-2005 10:15:21] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> its brilliant...
