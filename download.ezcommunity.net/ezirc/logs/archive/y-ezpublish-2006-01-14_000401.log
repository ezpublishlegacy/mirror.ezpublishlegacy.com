[01-12-2006 02:53:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> morning 'vribody :)
[01-12-2006 02:57:43] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> quick question: with viewcaching on, shouldn't the cache for a full view of a node be cleared not only on change of the node but also of its (reverse) related objects by default? :)
[01-12-2006 02:59:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> or it would if I turno off SmartCacheClear'
[01-12-2006 03:05:08] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> fh: hovik kris10an and all eZ crew : when will someone write some documentation for viewcache.ini parameters ?? :)
[01-12-2006 03:06:17] [#ezpublish] <fh> as soon as we possibly can.. but even that may be some time in the future :/
[01-12-2006 03:08:23] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> fh: can you give me an on-the-fly  pointer on my above question ?
[01-12-2006 03:09:39] [#ezpublish] <fh> that sounds reasonable yes
[01-12-2006 03:11:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> so turning off this smartcacheclear it should also clear cache for node XYZ if I add to it or modify some (reverse) related objs fh ?
[01-12-2006 03:11:50] [#ezpublish] <fh> afaik yes, but I must be honest and say that I'm not entirely certain
[01-12-2006 03:11:57] [#ezpublish] <fh> I'm looking forward to clean up that mess in 4.0
[01-12-2006 03:14:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok ... or any quick rule I could put on viewcache.ini.append to do just that fh ? I stumbled upon a page in the forums with that sometime ago but I cannot find it anymore
[01-12-2006 03:27:22] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> sulfur check the old smartcachclear doc
[01-12-2006 03:34:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> DiGiTa|__: ok thanks!
[01-12-2006 03:35:15] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but DiGiTa|__ where is the link to old doc ? I cannot find it anymore on ez.no/doc

[01-12-2006 03:37:08] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> tnx DiGiTa|__
[01-12-2006 03:52:12] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> I'm dyyyyyying! I have no eZ-ing to do :P Although, if all works out I'll have more than I can handle alone in a few weeks :)

[01-12-2006 11:35:26] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hmmmmmm....
[01-12-2006 11:35:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the quickest way I see is to use an operator which does url_encode_string 's PHP function
[01-12-2006 11:36:15] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ( or some function named like that )
[01-12-2006 11:36:41] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> as it is a one-aparameter-only function, you can get it in a snap y adding a line to your ini file
[01-12-2006 11:36:54] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> interesting : how ?
[01-12-2006 11:37:03] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> let's see if I have an url for it
[01-12-2006 11:37:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> Sulfur: that's fine there is the encode operator
[01-12-2006 11:37:51] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ;)

[01-12-2006 12:53:08] [#ezpublish] <CoderForLife> anyone home?  I'd like to know when a version of ezPublish is planned to be available that works with PHP 5.0.4
[01-12-2006 12:54:10] [#ezpublish] <CoderForLife> as indicated on the website, ezPublish  3.7.2 does not
[01-12-2006 12:54:48] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I assume it is plan for eZ 4.0 / June 2006 => check the roadmap on ez.no website
[01-12-2006 12:55:14] [#ezpublish] <CoderForLife> ah - missed the roadmap - I'll look - thanks
