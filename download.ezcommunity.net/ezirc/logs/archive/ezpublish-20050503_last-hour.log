[05-03-2005 01:06:24] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> so many exceptions
[05-03-2005 01:06:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> why that? messed up?!?!
[05-03-2005 01:07:09] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> its quite easy at the countrary to german.
[05-03-2005 01:07:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> or chinese
[05-03-2005 01:08:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> well .. back to work:
[05-03-2005 01:08:30] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> not sure about german... haven't really tried to learn.. chinese just has a lot of letters

[05-03-2005 01:08:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> at first can u interpret this error message?
[05-03-2005 01:09:21] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> ha! your fault not mine
[05-03-2005 01:09:34] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> you opened {let} and closed it with {/section} or vice versa
[05-03-2005 01:09:41] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> http://www.plainlanguage.gov/examples/humor/marktwain.php
[05-03-2005 01:09:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this is only the first step to come closer to your fault ;) hehe
[05-03-2005 01:09:55] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hehehe
[05-03-2005 01:09:57] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> fair enough
[05-03-2005 01:10:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i will put the code on nopaste, w8.
[05-03-2005 01:10:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> http://nopaste.php-q.net/131373
[05-03-2005 01:11:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> the line 10 is analog to the line 75 in error-log
[05-03-2005 01:12:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i cant see a failure.
[05-03-2005 01:13:07] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> paste whole tpl
[05-03-2005 01:13:10] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> how many lines
[05-03-2005 01:13:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ok
[05-03-2005 01:16:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> http://nopaste.php-q.net/131374
[05-03-2005 01:16:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> its only an addition to the standard full/folder.tpl
[05-03-2005 01:18:48] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> cleared all caches?
[05-03-2005 01:18:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> if you delete the lines between line 65 to 83, no error would be printed out.
[05-03-2005 01:19:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> yep, cleared all caches.
[05-03-2005 01:19:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> --clear-all
[05-03-2005 01:19:35] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> what happens if you get rid of the {let} wrapping around it
[05-03-2005 01:19:44] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> clear from admin panel too
[05-03-2005 01:19:53] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> i find the commandline one doesn't always clear everything
[05-03-2005 01:20:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> doh
[05-03-2005 01:20:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> really? havent controlled that.
[05-03-2005 01:20:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> still errors.
[05-03-2005 01:20:49] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> maybe it was just my badluck though :P
[05-03-2005 01:21:02] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> get rid of the {let} wrapping around
[05-03-2005 01:21:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ok ... i will delete the let
[05-03-2005 01:22:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> here comes you fault in the game ;)
[05-03-2005 01:22:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> "Unknown template variable 'folder_node_id_array' in namespace ''"
[05-03-2005 01:22:27] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> scope=root instead of global
[05-03-2005 01:22:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> beacuse {section} create a new namespace.
[05-03-2005 01:23:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> oops... sorry, not true.
[05-03-2005 01:23:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> the set and the output is in the same namespace.
[05-03-2005 01:24:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> http://nopaste.php-q.net/131375
[05-03-2005 01:24:31] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> and its saying unknown template variable?
[05-03-2005 01:24:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> folder_node_id_array=$folder_node_id_array|append($folder.item.main_node.node_id)
[05-03-2005 01:25:07] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i feel here is a let necessary
[05-03-2005 01:25:17] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ?!?!
[05-03-2005 01:25:23] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> no let
[05-03-2005 01:25:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> "Unknown template variable 'folder_node_id_array' in namespace ''" this appears twice, because of the section loop
[05-03-2005 01:26:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> {set scope=global folder_node_id_array=$folder_node_id_array|append($folder.item.main_node.node_id)}
[05-03-2005 01:26:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i will delete the scope
[05-03-2005 01:26:22] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> k
[05-03-2005 01:27:22] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> if it doesn't work, outside the {sections}
[05-03-2005 01:27:35] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> do {set folder_node_id_array=array()}
[05-03-2005 01:27:46] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> then remove the scope and leave the other line the same
[05-03-2005 01:30:52] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> i'm doing the same thing basically like this:
[05-03-2005 01:31:06] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> {set myvar=hash('blah','val')}
[05-03-2005 01:31:35] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> {section show=eq(1,1)}{set myvar=$myvar|merge(hash('blah2','var2'))}{/section}
[05-03-2005 01:31:39] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> and it works for me......
[05-03-2005 01:35:22] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> any luck?
[05-03-2005 01:35:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> http://nopaste.php-q.net/131376
[05-03-2005 01:35:59] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> not really
[05-03-2005 01:36:26] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> lol the code just doesn't like you today
[05-03-2005 01:36:34] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hehe
[05-03-2005 01:36:47] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> why section-exclude?
[05-03-2005 01:37:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ensures that any related images are not included in your related items list.
[05-03-2005 01:38:38] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> sec tryin it on my site
[05-03-2005 01:38:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this would be nice.
[05-03-2005 01:39:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> just relate some node inheriting some articles to folder, and display this folder.

[05-03-2005 01:54:37] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hmf doesn't want to update the new template
[05-03-2005 01:55:54] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> actually.. just doesn't want to print anything after line 79
[05-03-2005 01:57:33] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> very weird... it stops printing right after the last {/section}
[05-03-2005 01:59:05] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> does section-exclude even exist...?
[05-03-2005 01:59:19] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> thats your problem

[05-03-2005 03:29:25] [#ezpublish] <@fh> like that?
[05-03-2005 03:29:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;) yeah ... if some bugs from 3.5 are knocked out.
[05-03-2005 03:30:20] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> bugs like that: http://ez.no/bugs/view/6580 ;)
[05-03-2005 03:33:41] [#ezpublish] <@fh> yep, it's on the list
[05-03-2005 03:34:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so its fixed in 3.6, when it will be fixed in 3.5 stable? how runs the bugfix process?
[05-03-2005 03:34:58] [#ezpublish] <@fh> I don't think it's fixed in 3.6
[05-03-2005 03:35:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> shouldnt it be fixed in 3.5 stable at first before in 3.6 beta?
[05-03-2005 03:35:07] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ahhh
[05-03-2005 03:35:14] [#ezpublish] <@fh> usually we fix bugs in the oldest stable
[05-03-2005 03:35:25] [#ezpublish] <@fh> and then merge into newer stable releases until we reach trunk
[05-03-2005 03:35:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, this is the way to go, as usual.
[05-03-2005 03:36:04] [#ezpublish] <@fh> unless the bug requires big structural changes, then we fix it in trunk only
[05-03-2005 03:36:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ah
[05-03-2005 03:37:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> probably u could help me, with this, if u have some minutes. http://ez.no/community/forum/setup_design/template_building_an_array_of_ids_for_further_processing
[05-03-2005 03:51:38] [#ezpublish] <@fh> tested the logic in 3.5.1 like this:

[05-03-2005 04:11:14] [#ezpublish] <th[eZ]> Anyone here has experienced the Online Editor - Internet Explorer blinking bug?
[05-03-2005 04:11:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> not really, IE isnt seen on my screen. ;)
[05-03-2005 04:12:19] [#ezpublish] <th[eZ]> I'm currently trying to research the issue, but we're not able to reproduce the set up yet
[05-03-2005 04:12:41] [#ezpublish] <th[eZ]> so I'm looking for info on affected versions
[05-03-2005 04:13:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but .. sometimes the toolbar flickers on firefox
[05-03-2005 04:13:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> could this be the same problem?
[05-03-2005 04:13:42] [#ezpublish] <th[eZ]> wouldn't think so. this other issue are probably an IE bug
[05-03-2005 04:13:57] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> k
[05-03-2005 04:14:12] [#ezpublish] <th[eZ]> but what kind of flickering are you talking about?
[05-03-2005 04:14:26] [#ezpublish] <th[eZ]> serious stuff? or just minor?
[05-03-2005 04:15:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well, sorry i have to say now this was a older problem which vannished after a svn update.
[05-03-2005 04:16:00] [#ezpublish] <th[eZ]> ok

[05-03-2005 20:21:10] [#ezpublish] <rw> hi
[05-03-2005 20:21:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hey!
[05-03-2005 20:21:31] [#ezpublish] <rw> I just installed it my system, I was used to mambo! Ez Publish is great!
[05-03-2005 20:21:45] [#ezpublish] <rw> the translation feature (aka mambelfish in mambo) isn't that good.
[05-03-2005 20:21:50] [#ezpublish] <rw> in ez publish is awesome!
[05-03-2005 20:22:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> cool. sho nuff
[05-03-2005 20:22:48] [#ezpublish] <rw> I am just having a hard time to find how to add option in the main page so the user can choose from all the translated languages, right now two. Any idea?
[05-03-2005 20:23:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so what are you going to do with eZ publish
[05-03-2005 20:23:39] [#ezpublish] <rw> right now it will be a website for my "brother"
[05-03-2005 20:23:57] [#ezpublish] <rw> which died almost 2 years ago. His father created an organization to help people.
[05-03-2005 20:23:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Weeeelll, that's a good question
[05-03-2005 20:24:37] [#ezpublish] <rw> hehehe
[05-03-2005 20:24:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think you need to manually add links into your pagelayout
[05-03-2005 20:25:01] [#ezpublish] <rw> i've just installed, I think I will test it a little bit more before doing a theme.
[05-03-2005 20:25:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> like http://ez.no/ has 3 in the top right and side
[05-03-2005 20:25:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods
[05-03-2005 20:25:22] [#ezpublish] <rw> yeah! true I see
[05-03-2005 20:26:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't think eZ publish currently has a drop down / auto gen list of per item translations.
[05-03-2005 20:26:32] [#ezpublish] <rw> not really important to me, add links it's ok...
[05-03-2005 20:27:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> If I were you, and I was really intersted in that kind of functionality I would first (search ez.no via google for lots of possible keywords) and if you can't find a past thread that answeres your question, simply start a new thread and refernece any past relevant threads along with a very detailed description of what you would like to know how to accomplish.
[05-03-2005 20:27:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hehe
[05-03-2005 20:28:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> as i throw myself out with the bathwater ..
[05-03-2005 20:28:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> still, it's what I would do ...
[05-03-2005 20:28:31] [#ezpublish] <rw> yeah I will do it...
[05-03-2005 20:28:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think that someone has even asked this question before ...
[05-03-2005 20:28:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but ... i don't recall a stand up solution but I could have missed the bus ...
