[04-25-2006 04:05:24] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hello
[04-25-2006 04:05:32] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I will try to answer it if it is simple
[04-25-2006 04:05:36] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I have a problem with set
[04-25-2006 04:05:50] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> yes
[04-25-2006 04:05:58] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> {def $var = 0}{set $var=9} {$var}
[04-25-2006 04:06:05] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> this outputs 0
[04-25-2006 04:06:05] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> should write 9
[04-25-2006 04:06:16] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I can't change my $var
[04-25-2006 04:06:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> no error ?
[04-25-2006 04:06:48] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> no
[04-25-2006 04:06:49] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> and what about doing this {def var=0}{set $var=9}{$var}
[04-25-2006 04:06:49] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> in debug ?
[04-25-2006 04:06:57] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> It works in other templates
[04-25-2006 04:07:07] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok
[04-25-2006 04:07:09] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> hmm gonna test kalooni
[04-25-2006 04:07:17] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it is cache blocked ?
[04-25-2006 04:07:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> clear all caches

[04-25-2006 04:07:35] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> What is with this $var or var thing? and sometimes $Var?
[04-25-2006 04:08:04] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Can
[04-25-2006 04:08:29] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Can't have "{set variable=1}" the parser needs $
[04-25-2006 04:09:10] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> I think you can do {def my_var=1} ... I didn't say {set my_var=1}

[04-25-2006 04:10:05] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok, I thought this was doable
[04-25-2006 04:10:08] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Can one have inline php in eZ?
[04-25-2006 04:10:26] [#ezpublish] <zrg> not in tempates
[04-25-2006 04:10:30] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> "raped_smarty" is so ineffective =)
[04-25-2006 04:12:12] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Perhaps it's a security features to not include php through eval
[04-25-2006 04:15:40] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> {$totalrake} ...

[04-25-2006 04:52:01] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> I am using {if} now, and it works
[04-25-2006 04:52:24] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> They should think about adding php as an optional template language
[04-25-2006 04:52:40] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> The tpl language they have made is worse than asm =)
[04-25-2006 04:54:14] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> If they are so good, they should evaluate using javascript or some other real language, "raped smarty" isn't very geniously implemented

[04-25-2006 04:54:36] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> lol :) I think they are trying to improve this field ... for the version 4.0
[04-25-2006 04:54:53] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> For my company's cms system, we just use php
[04-25-2006 04:55:02] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Then we have all the richness of language
[04-25-2006 04:55:05] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> the language
[04-25-2006 05:18:56] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> than it's not really a cms
[04-25-2006 05:19:01] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> in my mind

[04-25-2006 07:05:26] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> DiGiTa|_: I think you're wrong =) What type of language is used for the templating system is irrelevant as long as it is easy
[04-25-2006 07:05:57] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> DiGiTa|_: And if you are typing {$obj.contentobject.name} or <?= $this->page->name ?> doesn't really matter does it?
[04-25-2006 07:06:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> there are pro's and con's for xml based templating languages
[04-25-2006 07:06:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> personally i don't like them
[04-25-2006 07:06:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> it can be neat to use xml autocompletion in some editors though
[04-25-2006 07:12:04] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> Anyhow, eZ is more a IDE than a CMS
[04-25-2006 07:12:12] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> It's way too deep for a normal content management system
[04-25-2006 07:12:37] [#ezpublish] <m0ns00n> It's a development environment and content management system so to speak

[04-25-2006 12:40:49] [#ezpublish] <scandic> I have a few questions about ezpublish. I need to choose a cms/framework for a large community project.
[04-25-2006 12:41:34] [#ezpublish] <scandic> 1. Is it possible to register users in differentz groups i.e. photographers and models with different profiles?
[04-25-2006 12:42:08] [#ezpublish] <scandic> 2. Is there a kind of api to insert payment gateways in the registration process?
[04-25-2006 12:42:44] [#ezpublish] <scandic> 3. Is it possible to use different site templates for each entry in the pagetree?
[04-25-2006 12:43:58] [#ezpublish] <scandic> 4. Are time limited memberships possible?
[04-25-2006 12:44:08] [#ezpublish] <scandic> That's all for now :)

[04-25-2006 12:58:55] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> scandic: 1. yes
[04-25-2006 12:59:02] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> 2. yes
[04-25-2006 12:59:08] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> 3. yes
[04-25-2006 12:59:23] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> 4. Yes, maybe you have to write a small script for that
[04-25-2006 12:59:37] [#ezpublish] <scandic> Sounds really good.
[04-25-2006 12:59:48] [#ezpublish] <scandic> I have to write alot of scripts so it doesnt matter at all :)
[04-25-2006 13:00:00] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> 2. you can define override templates for classes, subtrees, sections, and even every node
[04-25-2006 13:01:47] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> i have to leave
[04-25-2006 13:01:48] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> bye

[04-25-2006 13:28:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> scandic: define large
[04-25-2006 13:28:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> currently, ezpublish probably is limited to about 500000 objects
[04-25-2006 13:28:37] [#ezpublish] <scandic> buz: about 2000-4000 concurrent users
[04-25-2006 13:28:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> you will need some massive hardware for that
[04-25-2006 13:29:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> (with any cms, really)
[04-25-2006 13:29:11] [#ezpublish] <scandic> We have two 16 cpu core systems with 32gb ram each
[04-25-2006 13:29:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok that should be plenty
[04-25-2006 13:29:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> what types of core (just interested ;)
[04-25-2006 13:29:42] [#ezpublish] <scandic> opteron
[04-25-2006 13:30:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> hard to say
[04-25-2006 13:30:09] [#ezpublish] <scandic> physical 8 opteron 875 for each server
[04-25-2006 13:30:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> i get 10pages/second on a athlon64
[04-25-2006 13:30:22] [#ezpublish] <scandic> eeeek....
[04-25-2006 13:30:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> with some tuning maybe 20/s
[04-25-2006 13:30:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> so would likely get about 500 pages/s
[04-25-2006 13:30:56] [#ezpublish] <scandic> that's not really much...
[04-25-2006 13:31:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> should be plenty for 4000 users
[04-25-2006 13:31:09] [#ezpublish] <scandic> because one server is for database only
[04-25-2006 13:31:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> ezpublish places much more load on the frontend servers than on the db
[04-25-2006 13:32:27] [#ezpublish] <scandic> I've made a static html apache benchmark with about 2000 running apache threads delivering 16750 pages/s
[04-25-2006 13:32:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> sounds about right

[04-25-2006 13:33:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> lighttpd would likely push about double of what apache does
[04-25-2006 13:33:16] [#ezpublish] <scandic> in worst case we could double the ram for the webserver

[04-25-2006 13:34:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> ram probably wont hurt you
[04-25-2006 13:34:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sry for the double post guys, ciao
[04-25-2006 13:34:38] [#ezpublish] <scandic> Maybe... but I think apache wouldn't be the bottleneck when using ezpublish :)
[04-25-2006 13:34:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> cpu load might
[04-25-2006 13:34:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> no
[04-25-2006 13:35:35] [#ezpublish] <scandic> I will install ezpublish now and will see how it compares in speed to typo3
[04-25-2006 13:35:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> last time i looked, i found typo3 very slow
[04-25-2006 13:35:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> that was around 3.8 i think
[04-25-2006 13:36:42] [#ezpublish] <scandic> There is a really good reason not to use typo3 - it has no reasonable forum software
[04-25-2006 13:36:54] [#ezpublish] <scandic> and I don't have the time to code a forum, too.
[04-25-2006 13:36:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> up for discussion if ez got one
[04-25-2006 13:37:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> personally i dont consider ez.no like forums reasonable
[04-25-2006 13:37:54] [#ezpublish] <scandic> they're okay. the forum is just a little part of the community.
[04-25-2006 13:38:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> shameless plug: look at http://triligon.org/triligon/projects/advancedforum
