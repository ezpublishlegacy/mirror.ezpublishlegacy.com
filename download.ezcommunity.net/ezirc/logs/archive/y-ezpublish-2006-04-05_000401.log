[04-03-2006 10:27:27] [#ezpublish] <zrg> good :)
[04-03-2006 10:28:44] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> but I'm conserned with the fact that those files will be overwritten upon an upgrade
[04-03-2006 10:30:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> save the changes as patches
[04-03-2006 10:30:42] [#ezpublish] <zrg> then you can semiautomatically repatch after upgrade

[04-03-2006 10:34:19] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I'm not too familiar with doing anything with the kernel until now, so I really have no idea what you mean... ;)

[04-03-2006 10:55:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> that one starts with not using windows, really

[04-03-2006 12:53:04] [#ezpublish] <ls> hi
[04-03-2006 12:54:21] [#ezpublish] <ls> Tidemann, I was looking on 3.8 triggers list and there is shop-updatebasket-after might be solution which you were looking last time
[04-03-2006 12:57:39] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> ls: triggerlist where?
[04-03-2006 12:57:52] [#ezpublish] <ls> 3.8
[04-03-2006 12:58:34] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> sorry .. I'm a bit confused .. I'm in the middle of making another shop-hack here ;)
[04-03-2006 12:59:07] [#ezpublish] <ls> well ;) have you tried 3.8beta1?
[04-03-2006 12:59:44] [#ezpublish] <ls> Take a look on triggers list, you can do worflow event and some action after basket update
[04-03-2006 13:06:53] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> so it's fixed in 3.8beta1?
[04-03-2006 13:09:05] [#ezpublish] <ls> I would say it is added couple new triggers which makes life easier ;) I haven't look if there is INI settings, but you can write workflow event, so hacking is no need
[04-03-2006 13:10:12] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> well.. I still need the hack for addToBasket
[04-03-2006 13:11:21] [#ezpublish] <ls> there is also trigger for this

[04-03-2006 13:13:24] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you are using same variable both for object and text
[04-03-2006 13:13:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yeah
[04-03-2006 13:14:08] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I was just finished editing all the variables and testing them when you pointed it out ;)
[04-03-2006 13:17:28] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> zrg: so it works now.. only the boolean value "express" fails now...
[04-03-2006 13:18:19] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> I guess that's because it's handled as text
[04-03-2006 13:18:27] [#ezpublish] <zrg> you'll find out how boolean values are used
[04-03-2006 13:19:15] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> allready on it
[04-03-2006 13:21:27] [#ezpublish] <zrg> when you have it all figured out, maybe you will write how to on forum?
[04-03-2006 13:23:38] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> yup
[04-03-2006 13:24:33] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> just have to figure how to rewrite $expressNode->appendChild( $doc->createTextNode( $express ) ); to handle bool... i think...

[04-03-2006 16:02:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> same block of text, different substitution: Quotables: ?By making use of the data
[04-03-2006 16:02:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'll run it through again tho with the flag
[04-03-2006 16:03:37] [#ezpublish] <zrg> charset conversions
[04-03-2006 16:03:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm, in ez?
[04-03-2006 16:03:59] [#ezpublish] <zrg> mysql
[04-03-2006 16:04:38] [#ezpublish] <zrg> at some point in export or import it does conversion
[04-03-2006 16:05:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ok, thank you, i think it's import because the exports have (checked 2x) been free of these char replacments
[04-03-2006 16:05:27] [#ezpublish] <zrg> how did you check?
[04-03-2006 16:05:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the setup is all eng-GB for regular old usa site with no need for alt languages or charsets .. umm
[04-03-2006 16:05:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> terminal uses?
[04-03-2006 16:06:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i checked by less dump.sql and searching for the text (the text not the wierd chars)
[04-03-2006 16:06:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i found all instances of the text but it had the proper characters " etc ..
[04-03-2006 16:06:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> via ssh / term :)
[04-03-2006 16:06:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> what charset is term under?
[04-03-2006 16:07:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm uncertain, checking
[04-03-2006 16:08:27] [#ezpublish] <zrg> what has happened to me is i do dump from base with iso8859 charset and (unwanted) conversion occurs at export into utf-8, but when i view with less it looks ok because my terminal IS on utf8
[04-03-2006 16:08:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> using xterm i guess but no listed charset in `env`

[04-03-2006 18:39:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so i believe i've eliminated any sql wierdness issues (since i was able to make a complete copy in separate dev)
[04-03-2006 18:40:24] [#ezpublish] <kracker> now the question remains ... why does ez 3.6.7 turn the double quotes into question marks ? (the new real true problem remaining)
