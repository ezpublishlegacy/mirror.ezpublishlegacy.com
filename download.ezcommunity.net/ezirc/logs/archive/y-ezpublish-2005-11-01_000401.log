[11-01-2005 02:00:36] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> I hope I get to see a couple of zombies
[11-01-2005 02:46:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> one day late no?
[11-01-2005 03:01:27] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> hm...ah, yes
[11-01-2005 03:01:34] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> so I was disapointed then
[11-01-2005 03:01:35] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> no zombies
[11-01-2005 03:02:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh
[11-01-2005 03:03:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think they might prefer to be called the living impared :D

[11-01-2005 03:46:30] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> hmmm... you think the log of what was discussed here will be useful for anyone who is not here? i think there will be way to much ravens and zoombies for this...

[11-01-2005 03:55:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> kh[eZ], you know I often wonder like many others just what is missed when not active or passivly in #ezpublish the log has been requested by several others over the course of my time in #ezpublish (over the years). One day I took action to answere these requests and setup the log
[11-01-2005 03:57:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> I think that the log over time can help encourage people who might only occacionaly visit or participate in #ezpublish to visit and contribute more often, leading to a more active #ezpublish
[11-01-2005 04:01:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> anyway it's late or early depending on your point of view :D i'm crashing, tomorrow I take the next step towards the future, eZ partnership! whoooah!
[11-01-2005 04:11:22] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> ok.. i just think its abit hard to look for something special in between all the garbage...
[11-01-2005 04:11:34] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> kongrats kracker!
[11-01-2005 04:11:50] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> good luck on your stepping...
[11-01-2005 04:12:44] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> a small step for kracker..
[11-01-2005 04:12:59] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> or maybe a big one...
[11-01-2005 04:13:03] [#ezpublish] <@kh[eZ]> ;-)
