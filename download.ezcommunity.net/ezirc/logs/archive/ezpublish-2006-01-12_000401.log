[01-11-2006 04:17:05] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> is there any specific setting I should set to have my Online Editor use the italian translation I made ? :)
[01-11-2006 04:17:28] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> as all the admin and frontend is in italian, I am wondering why it doesn't ....
[01-11-2006 04:18:04] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> Sulfur: The OE is currently not translated to italian. Please feel free to do so...
[01-11-2006 04:18:52] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kris10an: I did translate it and uploaded a complete alpha version yesterday night
[01-11-2006 04:19:11] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> Uploaded where?
[01-11-2006 04:19:36] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but I moved the translation to another setup which seems equal to me and I cannot have it use the it language, kris10an
[01-11-2006 04:19:43] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> contributions
[01-11-2006 04:20:00] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> maybe i should read everything you say before responding :-/
[01-11-2006 04:20:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> lol
[01-11-2006 04:20:37] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well you can help me in troubleshooting why in my new setup it appears not to work
[01-11-2006 04:20:55] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> 1. did you install it in the correct dir?
[01-11-2006 04:21:10] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> 2. did you clear the cache properly?
[01-11-2006 04:21:17] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> extensions/ezdthml/translations/ita-IT/translation.ts
[01-11-2006 04:21:33] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> extension without s
[01-11-2006 04:22:08] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> 3. does the other parts of the page translage to italian?
[01-11-2006 04:22:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes I thought it was that and rm -rf'ed var/cache
[01-11-2006 04:22:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes yes
[01-11-2006 04:22:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> 2- see above 3 - yes
[01-11-2006 04:24:04] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> no clue.
[01-11-2006 04:24:48] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> btw do you have a schema or something against which I can validate it ?
[01-11-2006 04:25:23] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> 4. do you get the textStrings in in the source of the page when you are editing some content with the editor?
[01-11-2006 04:25:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I think 4 needs some more explanation for me :)
[01-11-2006 04:26:01] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> edit some content
[01-11-2006 04:26:04] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> -> view source
[01-11-2006 04:26:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ah, you ask if it is not displayed ....
[01-11-2006 04:26:14] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> look for txtString
[01-11-2006 04:26:16] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> no , it uses the eng one
[01-11-2006 04:26:43] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the txtString string is not present in the page source
[01-11-2006 04:27:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> for the norwegian i have:  textStrings["InsertObject"]="Legg til objekt";
[01-11-2006 04:27:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ahh textStrings
[01-11-2006 04:27:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes, I have them, they are in english
[01-11-2006 04:28:33] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> do you have the debugoutput on, does it say anyting about not finding translations?
[01-11-2006 04:28:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the oe should use the RegionalSettings from the settings/myadminsiteaccess/site.ini.append.php right ?
[01-11-2006 04:28:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> point. checking.
[01-11-2006 04:30:44] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> hi all :)
[01-11-2006 04:30:57] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> is it possible to sort by a class attribute ?
[01-11-2006 04:31:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ( it should .... )
[01-11-2006 04:31:55] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> hu ?
[01-11-2006 04:32:15] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> sorry, my question isn't very accurate :p
[01-11-2006 04:32:24] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i created an "event" class which contain date of the event
[01-11-2006 04:32:32] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i would sort these items using this attribute
[01-11-2006 04:32:52] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> but only choice is "published, class identifier, class name, ..."
[01-11-2006 04:33:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> have you checked the docs ?
[01-11-2006 04:33:22] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> you want to sort from a fetch ?
[01-11-2006 04:33:28] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> not from the template
[01-11-2006 04:33:37] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> fetch list
[01-11-2006 04:33:38] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i whish to select that from the admin
[01-11-2006 04:33:52] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> the sorting select at bottom of "sub items"
[01-11-2006 04:33:53] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> sort_by .node.sort_array
[01-11-2006 04:34:09] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> $node.sort_array
[01-11-2006 04:34:28] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> DiGiTa|_: its what i have yet. But sort array is defined in admin isn't it ?
[01-11-2006 04:35:00] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> is the sorting method defined in the admin
[01-11-2006 04:35:22] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> no, there is not "sorting by class attribute" in the select box :-/
[01-11-2006 04:35:42] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i don't get it
[01-11-2006 04:35:55] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> you should set, sort by event date
[01-11-2006 04:36:04] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> exactly ! its what i want :)
[01-11-2006 04:36:12] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> but only choice is published date
[01-11-2006 04:36:49] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> (or class identifer, class name, level, modification date, name, priority and section)
[01-11-2006 04:37:09] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kris10an: ... bummer. I cannot access my admin install after clearing caches. I am experiencing the white screen of doom.
[01-11-2006 04:37:34] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> lol
[01-11-2006 04:38:48] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> seasonfive if you set the evvent date as name in your class you will be able to sort by name
[01-11-2006 04:38:49] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> really annoying especially because I haven't found a surefire way to get my install working again when it hapens
[01-11-2006 04:39:14] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> DiGiTa|_: hmm, seems good :)
[01-11-2006 04:39:30] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ohhh seems that TRUNCATING ezsession worked
[01-11-2006 04:39:30] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> DiGiTa|_: could i do <event_date> + <event_title> ?
[01-11-2006 04:39:45] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes
[01-11-2006 04:39:47] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> you can
[01-11-2006 04:40:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kris10an:  ... I get a slew of "No translation for file(translation.ts) in context(design/standard/ezdhtml): 'Insert object' with comment()"
[01-11-2006 04:41:40] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> argh, i have to re-create object with the new version of the class i think ?
[01-11-2006 04:42:30] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> yes
[01-11-2006 04:42:51] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ok, thanks for help :)
[01-11-2006 04:42:57] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> or just edit
[01-11-2006 04:43:01] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> and publish
[01-11-2006 04:43:07] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it will be enough
[01-11-2006 04:44:38] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> Sulfur: then something is wrong with your setup :-)
[01-11-2006 04:44:54] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> date is "Monday xx Month 200x", that's not good for sorting. Can i use <date|datetime(mine)> ?
[01-11-2006 04:45:43] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kris10an: that's what I am trying to glean ... but what else do I need to do aside from dropping the file in the right dir? it has the same name as the ita-IT directory in shate/translations
[01-11-2006 04:46:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> shaRe
[01-11-2006 04:47:06] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> i think that should be sufficient... and offcourse you need to clear all the cache (template, translation..)
[01-11-2006 04:48:02] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> and ensure that you have the correct Locale=nor_NO in site.ini
[01-11-2006 04:48:09] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> for the siteaccess...
[01-11-2006 04:48:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I did that kris10an , the only difference I find is that fr ex, french translation has an utf-8 encoding while my trasnlation is us-ascii
[01-11-2006 04:48:36] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> Locale=ita-IT
[01-11-2006 04:48:37] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ContentObjectLocale=ita-IT
[01-11-2006 04:48:37] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> TextTranslation=enabled
[01-11-2006 04:49:08] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I seem to recall a bug due to a different encoding blocking loading by javascript ... hmm , that would be weird
[01-11-2006 05:05:22] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> it works on another installation, when you did the same, right?
[01-11-2006 05:06:42] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> check the settings of locale with this:  grep "Locale=" `find . |grep "site.ini"`

[01-11-2006 06:41:43] [#ezpublish] <enzo> hi
[01-11-2006 06:43:41] [#ezpublish] <enzo> imagine, i configure 2 virtual hosts on the same ez install, is it possible to give a role to somebody but only to one virtual host ?
[01-11-2006 06:44:05] [#ezpublish] <enzo> and another role (or the same) to another user for the other virtual host ?
[01-11-2006 06:47:38] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> i don't get it
[01-11-2006 06:47:59] [#ezpublish] <enzo> you don't see what i mean DiGiTa|__ ?
[01-11-2006 06:48:07] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> not really
[01-11-2006 06:48:21] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> what do you want to do
[01-11-2006 06:48:47] [#ezpublish] <enzo> i want to have 2 websites sharing the same database foo1.example.org and foo2.example.org
[01-11-2006 06:48:59] [#ezpublish] <enzo> news are on foo1 and on foo2
[01-11-2006 06:49:21] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> ah yes
[01-11-2006 06:49:30] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> i do that already
[01-11-2006 06:49:33] [#ezpublish] <enzo> and i'd like some user to edit news from foo1, and other user to edit news from foo1 AND foo2 (much access)
[01-11-2006 06:49:40] [#ezpublish] <enzo> it's possible ?
[01-11-2006 06:49:47] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> yes
[01-11-2006 06:49:51] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> create 2 siteaccess
[01-11-2006 06:50:04] [#ezpublish] <enzo> yes i will, but then ?
[01-11-2006 06:50:31] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> than for example
[01-11-2006 06:50:54] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> to editor role, add the read/news ans create/news
[01-11-2006 06:50:58] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> policy
[01-11-2006 06:51:13] [#ezpublish] <enzo> yes
[01-11-2006 06:51:20] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> than create 2 users
[01-11-2006 06:51:24] [#ezpublish] <enzo> but where do i define the siteaccess?
[01-11-2006 06:51:28] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> with the same editor role
[01-11-2006 06:51:35] [#ezpublish] <enzo> i understand
[01-11-2006 06:51:51] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> and constrain the user role to the siteaccess
[01-11-2006 06:53:12] [#ezpublish] <enzo> well i don't see the siteaccess
[01-11-2006 06:53:39] [#ezpublish] <enzo> but i've only one siteaccess for now, maybe if i have many, the backoffice will give another choice to choose the siteaccess?
[01-11-2006 06:53:40] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> well in your user settings
[01-11-2006 06:53:59] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> you can assign the role to a subtree
[01-11-2006 06:54:07] [#ezpublish] <enzo> yes
[01-11-2006 06:54:17] [#ezpublish] <enzo> ahh a site is an element of the subtree?
[01-11-2006 06:54:59] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> well now it depends, do you use the same subtree for the 2 sites ?
[01-11-2006 06:56:00] [#ezpublish] <enzo> if i use the same subtree, the content structure will be the same for the 2 sites right ?
[01-11-2006 06:56:10] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> yes
[01-11-2006 06:56:17] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> but it will be problematic
[01-11-2006 06:56:18] [#ezpublish] <enzo> so i won't use the same subtree
[01-11-2006 06:56:22] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> ok
[01-11-2006 06:56:34] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> so you can do as i say to you
[01-11-2006 06:56:42] [#ezpublish] <enzo> ok
[01-11-2006 06:56:51] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> 2 folders, one for each site
[01-11-2006 06:57:04] [#ezpublish] <enzo> i can assign a role to a subtree, or to many subtrees right ?
[01-11-2006 06:57:11] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> yes
[01-11-2006 06:57:17] [#ezpublish] <enzo> cool
[01-11-2006 06:57:27] [#ezpublish] <enzo> in fact i hesitate between typo3 and ezpublish
[01-11-2006 06:57:50] [#ezpublish] <enzo> typo3 do all what i want, but quite complex for a normal user ...
[01-11-2006 06:58:16] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> i don't really know typo3
[01-11-2006 06:58:21] [#ezpublish] <enzo> ok
[01-11-2006 06:58:28] [#ezpublish] <enzo> impressive tool
[01-11-2006 06:58:36] [#ezpublish] <enzo> very impressive
[01-11-2006 06:58:50] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> well ezp is impressive too :)
[01-11-2006 06:58:58] [#ezpublish] <enzo> yes i see it
[01-11-2006 06:59:13] [#ezpublish] <enzo> but i'im looing the ease of use
[01-11-2006 06:59:47] [#ezpublish] <enzo> i don't see extensions i can install in ez, where can i find that ?
[01-11-2006 06:59:55] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> enzo: for me it still really obscur. Tried typo3 for 3 days and i begined to be crazy :)
[01-11-2006 06:59:59] [#ezpublish] <enzo> for example, i would need a newsletter extension, a gant/pertt extension
[01-11-2006 07:00:09] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> here : http://ez.no/community/contribs
[01-11-2006 07:00:37] [#ezpublish] <enzo> i understand seasonfive, i've spent all yesterday to understand typo3, but you need at least one week
[01-11-2006 07:01:02] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> well one week is not enough to understand all the possibilities of a cms
[01-11-2006 07:01:12] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> you should use it in real situation

[01-11-2006 07:03:16] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> i don't think so
[01-11-2006 07:03:21] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> what is a vcard ?
[01-11-2006 07:03:33] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> DiGiTa|__: in 3 days i understand absolutly nothing in Typo3 :-p. Moreover i stoped when i saw it wasn't possible to user two different templates for a same plugin inside the same page.

[01-11-2006 07:03:50] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> :p
[01-11-2006 07:04:39] [#ezpublish] <enzo> there's an indexed search in ez ? i mean i add a .doc, .zip file, .pdf file, the search will be able to search into these files?
[01-11-2006 07:04:48] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> i think ezp is THE CMS
[01-11-2006 07:04:48] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> :)
[01-11-2006 07:05:10] [#ezpublish] <enzo> you have to try all to say that DiGiTa|__ :)
[01-11-2006 07:05:25] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> well i heard about others CMS
[01-11-2006 07:05:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> perhaps they have more features, but there are much more complex
[01-11-2006 07:06:00] [#ezpublish] <enzo> yes i confirm :(
[01-11-2006 07:06:13] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|__> so i prefer less features and something simple
[01-11-2006 07:06:14] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i don't see any common logic inside Typo3
[01-11-2006 07:06:29] [#ezpublish] <enzo> you're wrong there seasonfive
[01-11-2006 07:06:38] [#ezpublish] <enzo> the tree view is simple to understand
